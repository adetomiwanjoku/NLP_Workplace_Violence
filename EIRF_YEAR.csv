The CSS found that there was a group of teenagers outside his shop with mobile phones up videoing.  They were being verbally aggressive to the tenant and threatened to assault him.  The CSS advised them that they either had to leave the station or start traveling immediately.  That they weren't allowed to congregate in the ticket hall.  At this they because aggressive towards the CSS using threatening language and shoving mobile phones in the CSS face.  One of the group threw a bottle of water  at the Green Zen unit which the tenant kicked back at them.  

This was  then picked up by the same male who had been threatening assault against the CSS.  The male went to throw the bottle again and the CSS raised his arm to prevent it being thrown at him.

The teenage male continued to be abusive and threaten to  the CSS. Pushing his face into the CSS.  Saying that he was going to come back and hit me.  That I should get down on my knees and beg for forgiveness.  That he will end me.

The group then pushed through the gate line and went down to the platform.

CSS spoke to the tenant about the issue and then returned to the control room to report to the BTP 109 number.

22/02/2022 Undersigned spoke with Train Operator when he booked on. He confirmed events above. I also confirmed he was fit for duty and ready for his pick up. In summary, Train Operator initially made PA announcements at Queens Park to highlight no smoking and also asked male to remove himself from within the carriage's covid barrier. The male verbally abused the Train Operator and threatened him with physical violence at one point saying ""I will cut you"" as he reached inside his pocket. The Train Operator then announced that the train was going to be detrained as the male was being aggressive. The train half detrained and a member of public told the Train Operator that the male had left so the Train Operator allowed passengers back on the train and departed. At Kenton, the same male appeared running up the platform towards the front of the train and then banged on the droplight and was shouting abuse and threatening the Train Operator. He then walked down the platform ramp and picked up ballast and threw it at the front of the train. The Train Operator reported to the Signaller then departed the station. In hindsight, he stated that he should have reported the incident at Queens Park but he believed that the aggressive male had left his train

1945 I told them that I had seen them pushing through the gate earlier and since there were minor delays I did not know when exactly the next East bound train will arrive. When they heard this, they started kicking and pulling the gates going in circles. One of the kids who was wearing a black top and black shorts continuously kept coming up to the window, showing me his middle figure, and saying something which was not audible because I had switched off my microphone. With his body gestures and aggressive behaviour, He kept daring me to come out. When I pointed the body cam at him, he hid his face and finally decided to leave. They pushed through the gates and made their way to platform 2.
1947 Three more teenagers crawled underneath the gate 22 and made their way to platform 2

He was on Train 105 which was scheduled to reverse her at 19:06.  The customer first complained that he did not know the train was terminating here and that Kalif did not make any announcements. Kalif advised him that he had mad an announcement and that the train had a White City destination on the front since he had picked it up. He then complained that the doors that had opened were on the wrong side and Kalif explained that he had to open the doors on a specific side when reversing here so people didn't’t board the train for wrong direction travel. The customer continued to abuse him and Kalif said it took all of his self-control not to retaliate in kind. Kalif did say that the woman with the customer seemed ashamed with the way he was carrying on. Kalif also told me that his actions and aggression should be evident on the CCTV if there is a need to follow the incident up at a later date. 
 
He reported it to me as he was concerned that the customer may make a complaint. I checked with service control at the time of the call and they had not heard anything so hopefully we will not hear any more about it from the customer. I told Kalif he had done the right thing reporting it to me so we were prepared for it if any allegation was made and told him not to worry about it.  I also gave a duty of care and checked Kalif was OK  to continue with his duty he confirmed that although he was quite angry about  the way he was spoken to he was fine and continued to the end of his duty today.

Cancelling the last train potentially exposes staff to verbal and physical violence along with leaving passengers with no
means to get home late at night.  In both instances this arose on this occasion.  Night bus routes in the area are also extremely minimal.

verbal and physical violence along with leaving passengers with no means to get home late at night. Night bus routes in the
area are also extremely minimal.
A few observations:
1. ONA’s are written in a format gauged for train management and service control and not always easy to understand
2. There should be a means to highlight/communicate when a last train is cancelled
3. Nightshift duties in the HOH and Uxbridge area largely begin at 23:00hrs and there is not always time to read emails and
translate the ONA list.
4. Cancelling a last train has a much greater impact than other cancellations and therefore carries more risk of conflict.

I took this to be e a threat and agreed to let him out, which is what i would have done anyway so there was no need for a threat to me.
At this time another person forced the Wag exit Gate open without a ticket , which left the gates swinging backwards and forwards by themselves.
Also there is no cctv live feed or playback, and no recorded p.a.'s can be played, due to a fault with the equipment ( a new cctv system has just been installed and LUL and BTP can not get it to either down load or use play back or live feed). When the technician from Telent came they cancelled / withdrew the APCC job because the equipment was covered in mouse / rat droppings. When Laines arrived to treat the infestation as Telent were not prepared to work on the equipment until the infestation had been dealt with, Laines said that they could only work on and treat the infestation when in the presence of Telent because it is their equipment, so Telent and Laines both have to be here at the same time to resolve the situation. 
As a result we have no cctv, and no recorded p.a.'s playing, and i have just received an e-mail from the Area Manager giving an instruction to be on the gate line and booking hall area at all times because this is an instruction from senior management.
As this was going on a number of people that had just got off the train were again forcing themselves through the exit Wag gate without any tickets or using any type of payment method which left the Wag in a distressed state and condition where the paddles werevibrating backwards and forwards. Then a person asked me how to get to Gatwick Airport but seemed to have great difficulty in understanding the directions of any train on the west bound to West Ham and change for the Jubilee Line to London Bridge , and then get the National Rail to Gatwick. The person was white , english , about 40 years old, and i ended up writting it down for her. Then a person asked me to let them out of the gate line with a paper ticket from Chelmsford to zone 1 and 2. They said that they always buy this ticket and just get out at Plaistow station. The reason that it does not work is because Plaistow is a zone 3 , and not zone 1 or 2, so this ticket would not have worked during all the times that this person says that they buy and use this same ticket.. Then some people just forced the entry Wag open to enter the station without any ticket or payment method , right in front of me. This all happened in about 15 minutes of being on the gate line, after carrying out my station security check, as per instruction upon taking charge of a station.","Threat","","CSS2","","","","","","","","","","","",5,"","","Customers / people are so used to not paying anything for their journeys they seem to take it as an insult if you ask them have they paid for their journey or bought a ticket.

I noticed a male around 5ft 9 or 10 staggering making his way up to the ticket hall.
Upon his arrival in ticket hall, he approached staff on the gate line Emmanuel Babatunde and was interacting verbally with them.
I went onto the radio and asked them to allow the male to exit the station.
Immediately after I received a radio call from CSA Babatunde informing me that the male had   Collapsed in front of the station.
I immediately made my way out to assist 
Upon my arrival I was met with a male wearing a grey tracksuit short ,blue football t shirt and a dark shirt unbuttoned with a bag in his hand laying with legs wide opened facing the station and severely intoxicated with saliva coming out of his mouth and a wet crotch 
I immediately requested for staff to get me some gloves to assist the male.
CSA Nilesh made his way to the control room to get some gloves and returned and wasn't keen on helping the male as he was now swearing at us.
I removed the gloves from the staff hands and informed the male that I would assist him off the ground and would rest him against the wall, even though the male was now calling me a fucking bitch I felt that i needed to provide duty of care and assist him off the ground.
Before touching the male i pre warned him that i would provide him some support to get him off the ground.
As the male was on all fours now, I proceeded to put my hands under his arms in attempt to give him support to lift him up at that same moment the male decided to take his hand and push it up my uniform trousers going up my leg whilst caressing it and feeling me up making direct contact with my skin, which caused me to shake my leg and let go of the male in shock and disgust.
I then said to the male ( I can't believe that i am trying to help you and you feeling up my leg at the same time it's disgusting) to which the male apologised and said ( I am sorry) but immediately changed his tone and started back swearing at me and still calling me a fucking bitch to which I replied I am calling the police.
I had still asked a member of staff if he would assist the male and the staff said to what just happened No, so we left the male outside the station entrance where I proceeded to call the police from the control room.
I also called GST station and spoke to the CSM informing him on what had happened.
13:15hrs approximately Police called ref 276/01/08/2023 and all details given to BTP, I could see on the monitor that the male was helped to stand up by a passer-by and had entered the station.
I panicked and was now making live PA's requesting for Police assistance in the ticket hall.
The male left the station ticket hall very unsteady and was now harassing female passerby I liaised all that information to the police, by then the AM and CSM were at the station in the ticket hall.
I can see an interaction between the AM and the male on the monitor which I am still liaising with the BTP on the phone then I Notice the male extends his hand to shake hands with the AM, so I am now saying to the BTP I think my AM is trying to keep him outside till the BTP arrives.

Suddenly, and quite quickly, the commotion and loud noise stopped, He (MH) gestured it had calmed down. People were dispersing. I believe several customers had intervened attempting to separate the parties.

Also, it seemed CSA Charlotte Larbi was attempting to calm down and talked to the people, then she went into the Main Ticket Office, as I was approaching. There were two females already by the paid side of the Entry WAG and a male, who seemed to want to assist. As I approached, I informed my body camera was recording (I believe I said it twice or thrice, so to make sure they were aware). I asked how they were and the younger female said: ""Not well"" (or something like that) and also said someone had pulled her hair. I asked whether they wanted me to call the police and they said :""No"", as the police had already been called. I was puzzled and asked who had. One of them replied that my colleague (CL). So I replied that I did not think so, as it had to be myself who would have had to make the call (as in the CR). They were adamant CL had called the police. As I had not seen her near a phone, I was still very sceptical. They insisted and added: ""Go and ask her"". So I went to the Main Ticket Office door and called for CL. When she came out, she said she hadn't. As soon as she (CL) had said that, the females -who were now on the unpaid side- starting accusing her that she had said she was was going to. There was a discussion between them. I was continuously repeating that it had been a misunderstanding, but the females were very aggressively shouting and getting near to CL. I instructed CL to leave, but the discussion was still going on. CSA M. Hussain intervened as a physical  barrier placing himself between them (I believe his height helped). Then CL was leaving and I asked her to come to the Control Room (to find out what happened and how she was feeling), but she said no, as was going to the South gateline to release CSA L. Soon for his meal break. 
I asked the females -yet again-  if they wanted me to call the police. They were more focused into shouting at CL and did not reply to this. 
I was still wondering what they wanted from us. 
I believe at this stage they said they wanted to talk to a Supervisor. I mentioned that I am a Supervisor, but they did not want to talk to me. They wanted another supervisor. I had to return to the Control Room, and as I was leaving, one of them aggressively said they wanted my name and they were going to complain. I went back to them and showed them my badge. The younger one took a photo of it. She was the more aggressive and also the one who said her hair had been pulled (at this stage I did not know yet whether it had been a female, male or several people who she had had the fight with).

CSA Mark Ettienne phoned the CR, as the two females were waiting near the GLAP. He said they had calmed down, so I went out again to speak to them. I informed again the body camera was on. This time the female's attitude towards me was not aggressive anymore, also they said the issue was not with me, but with CL. Yet still they were demanding to see another 'Supervisor'. They were adamant. I told them again that I was the Supervisor and they demanded to know CL's name and also the name of the Managers (I had mentioned they were not around). I gave them CSM L.

I asked if the customer had a letter from authorities to state that his female companion was waiting for her replacement Freedom Pass and was told he had it.
I politely asked him to show it to me and he said it was on his phone but he couldn't find it,

I explained that whilst awaiting replacement ticket that the customer would still need to purchase a valid ticket for travel.
The male was abusive and insisted that i sack the staff member, I then explained that the staff was acting professionally and all the questions and answers had come from himself and that the staff member had not challenged him after he'd allowed the female through without paying.

(Bag described as large, 1 mtr length, ½ mtr width, heavy black with small fabric handle and two straps on the back with what appears to be very small wheels)

	(Description of VIP, White Female, 5'6, Red hair, black glasses, black cap, White trainers, blue trousers, white t-shirt with blue stripes on it)

	CSM confirms with CSS best alternative route to be the bus 168 which would take 18 minutes. 

15:47	CSM arrives on the way in WAG gate 21 to meet VIP, assess the bag and declares this to the VIP to be unsafe to carry on the escalator and staircase towards platform 2 northern line to waterloo so refuses travel on the underground on the grounds of safety. CSM offers to take the VIP personally to the bus station (Bus 168 direct to waterloo) however the VIP aggressively refuses and attempts to enter the gates. CSM apologises for inconvenience caused and maintains they will not allow travel due to safety reasons

15:48	VIP visibly upset begins to shout aggressively at CSM whilst claiming “I have done this before with my luggage many times, why wont you let me travel? Ill do it anyway! You’re not letting me in because I can’t see, you’re not letting me in because of discrimination. Usually, I have one person behind me, one person beside me and one person in front of me holding my luggage”. VIP shouts to other members of public in an attempt to undermine the decision ""She's refusing me travel, she's discriminating against me"". CSM stayed calm and continued to monitor and assist

15:49	CSM calmly responds to VIP repeating, several times during their interaction that the reason is only on the grounds of safety and apologises for inconvenience caused. 

15:50	As the VIP becomes progressively aggressive, she continues to raise her voice at the CSM threatening to put herself in danger by saying “I will enter, I don’t care”. Visibly unstable, she slightly stumbles across her luggage whilst frantically trying to fold her cane and place it into the back pocket of her large luggage, the CSM is nearly forced to help her up  but she managed to compose herself . When she attempts to lift the large case, both straps at the back snap and are completely unusable leaving only the small handle at the top available but with the weight she was unable to lift it after several attempts.  

15:51	VIP refuses to exit the station to board the bus and the safest and quickest alternative route so attempts to call out for assistance amongst the members of public. Many ignore however one couple approach and decline as they realise the luggage is far too heavy and that they were also going in another direction so expressed they were not able to assist. 

15:55	Whilst creating a human shield to prevent her entering the network, CSM calls CSS to call BTP to assist the VIP to the bus station with the CSM. 

CSM insists on apologising to the VIP for the inconvenience caused and continues to create a human shield to ensure no entry for the safety of others who will be using the escalator. Upon accepting entry had been refused, the VIP begin to calm down asking “how are you going to help me get my train now, I'm going to miss it? I don’t want to leave the station”. CSM responds “I am happy to assist you to the bus stop and talk to the driver, I will also ask for BTP to assist us outside.

07:14 CSS BH13 was called to the gateline as the customer now wanted to make a complaint. 
07:15 CSS BH13 with the customer. The customer said he wanted to make a complaint about CSA BH12 shrugging his shoulder as it had pissed him off. The customer was very angry and swearing as he was telling the CSS his complaint. He had a code 80 on his bank card and CSS BH12 advised him he would have to contact his bank. He stated he had money in there and his bank wouldn’t be open at 0700am. The CSS confirmed that was correct advice and that alternatively he could withdraw money and purchase a ticket or buy an oyster with the bank card at the machine. The customer said he had been told that already but he was pissed off at the staff shrugging his shoulders and told the CSA to come outside as he was so annoyed. The CSS relayed to the customer what they just said and the customer said that he had said the THREAT (customers words) after the CSA had shrugged their shoulders. The customer kept interrupting the CSS saying he knew what was going on here. The CSS explained that she had come out to listen to his complaint and nothing was going on, that she had to get his side of the story and the CSAs and then view CCTV. When the CSS probed further into the complaint the male said he had asked a second time for the CSA to make an exception and let him in and was again advised that he needed a ticket. CSS BH12 confirmed that the CSAs actions were correct. The male said he would just pay the fine, CSS BH13 advised the customer that the CSA would then be in trouble. CSS BH13 also advised the customer that we cannot check contactless and it has to be via the bank. The male was very agitated and said he worked in customer service and why did he shrug his shoulders. I said maybe when you asked a second time to be allowed to travel the staff shrugged saying they cant to that as a normal gesture, but the CSS said they would check the CCTV. The CSS obtained the customers details.

0700 The male becomes agitated and at two points tries to grab CSA BH12s right arm over the uts gate. CSA BH12 said at this point the male was telling him he is pissing him off and to step outside. He also accuses BH12 of ignoring him and that he has an attitude. CSA BH12 said he said to the customer he didn’t know what he was talking about as he was there trying to help him. 
0704 the male then goes to the MFM and CSA BH12 goes to the machine to help him. The customer confirmed he was going to buy an Oyster and CSA BH12 advised him how much it was. The male then asked if he would get  a refund on the oyster and he was advised No but it would handy to keep in case his card has issues in the future as an alternative payment.
0705 the customer stays near the MFM and CSA BH12 returns to the gateline. He said the customer was calm and they had no further interaction. The customer can be seen on his phone. 
0710 he tries his card on the WAG and it doesn’t work. (he has not purchased an oyster)
0712 the customer then throws what appears to be his phone on the floor. He then picks it up and appears to kick the MFM. Then he tries the MFM again. 
0713 he approaches CSA BH12 and asks to speak to a manager. CSA BH12 asked what for and the customer didn’t want to tell him. He eventually tells the CSA he wants to make a complaint. 

It appears the customer became aggressive when advised he could not have free travel due to a code 80 on his bank card. He openly admits he made a threat and blames it on the CSA shrugging. The CCTV does not show CSA BH13 shrugging anytime at the start of the conversation to warrant the male trying to grab the CSA and want to fight him outside.

On arrival, there found two vagrants with a dog in the last carriage smoking. They spoke with them and advised them to alight the train and depart the station.
BB03 also by then had made his way down to assess the situation. The male vagrant seemed calm but the female started kicking off in an irate manner and started cursing and swearing at staff. She then preceded to bang on the carriage of the next train that came into the platform and and preceded to verbally abuse BB24 about his race etc.
BB03 and BB24 spoke to her to calm down and exit the station before the BTP will be called to intervene in the matter if she continued.
BB24 at this point in time seemed very upset but remained profession in his stead and was told by BB03 and BB12 to go home after duty of care process followed. It did seem that BN24 was not in in the right frame of mind to continue his duty. He was however advised by BB03 to call back the next day to check in with the CSM team and if any support could be rendered depending on the call, it will be given.
2 X vagrants had exited the station at this point. Piccadilly line manager advised.","Verbal","","CSA1","","","","","","","","","","","",5,"","","2 X vagrants smoking and drinking in the last car which lead to smoke dissipating from carriage.","UK_IRF001285739","",20230806

This is the account of what happened on Sunday Evening at around 11:30pm.
A customer of Asian descent, late 40's to 50's gelled hair with a clutch bag, approached me and said his oyster card doesn't work on the card reader, I then looked at the code on the screen of the gate and advised the customer that it says please top up, he then presented cash in which I said unfortunately our machines only take card payments and if you have a card you can use it to top up your oyster card on the machine. Five minutes later he came back to me and said that his debit card doesn't work in the machine, I then said, use the next machine it might work in that one, because it was taking too long, I then said to him last westbound trains are 1 minute away I'll tap you through to get that last train, 1 minute later I hear shouting coming from the escalator and the same customer coming in my direction saying, you mother fucker you made me miss the last train, do you know who I am, he shouted other abusive words I can't remember and he invaded my personal space by coming right in my face with all these threats, other customers tried to calm him down, he then said what the fuck are you all looking at towards the public, I walked away towards the staff mess room area which is my place of safety, he continued to shout out threats as I did this. Amongst all of this I was by myself on the west gateline, and I really thought this guy was gonna hit me the rage that he had on his face, he put his bag down and stormed towards me, this is not what I should be dealing with, if he was to hit me no one would of got towards me in time if I was to be seriously hurt, anti social behaviour towards us staff is getting progressively worse and it has to stop.","Threat","","CSA1","","","","","","","","","","","",5,"","","A male customer who left it until the last minute, with insufficient money on his Oyster took out his frustration on missing the last westbound on a member of staff who had allowed him to travel, even though he needed to top up his card.
After trying to shout at me through the control room window, he eventually left the station.

The fact that this is a card only station causes a lot of problems for staff as the options to top up via cash locally are time limited and inconvenient due to the fact that customers have to go out of the station to top up.
This causes a lot of customers to feel aggrieved towards the staff, which is unfair.","UK_IRF001285816","",20230807

Male was talking loudly with the train manager about toilets being out of service. CSS DT then went to approach the train manager and the male who were at the train managers entrance. Male then walked past CSS DT saying “This is fucking ridiculous”. Male then went to the female door which at the time had a yellow barrier and a sign on the door informing customers the toilet is out of order. Male then moved the yellow barrier and proceed to try and open the female toilet door by using the handle. CSS DT informed the male that the toilet is out of order. 
Male responded I need to go toilet, CSS DT and CSA ES both tried to inform the customer that the toilet was closed and tried to inform the male of the nearest public toilet but the male kept interrupting. Male told staff the he will piss right here, whilst in CSS DT opinion trying to lower his zip for his jeans CSS DT informed the male if he did this the police will be called for the male due to criminal damage and indecent exposure. Male carried on swearing with words to the effect of I don’t care who you fucking call, call the fucking police.

I contacted LIS/Controller at approximately 22:13  to request BTP, ambulance and for the trains to arrive with caution on platform 1. Both CSA and CSS had to physically hold her down on the bench around the 2 car length from head wall for her own benefit. At this point I went down to the platform and requested CSA to go to the RVP point to direct the emergency services to the incident area. I identified myself and attempted engage with the customer who was in a highly emotional state and trying to break free. She stated” that she had broken up from her boyfriend and wanted to jump in front of a train and that she had made several attempts over the past two weeks”. At approximately 22:20 DRM arrived and assisted us with the situation with chasing up BTP as her behaviour was getting more aggressive. The customer calmed down and I suggested we all go upstairs for a drink of water which she readily agreed too, this was just a ploy as when she stood up she violently attempted to break free. All three of us restrained her on the bench and shortly later Customer Service Manager (CSM) England arrived to assist. At approximately 20:30hrs British Transport Police (BTP) officer’s lapel number 5415 and another arrived from Waterloo. Once I briefed them they took control of the customer and moved her to a cross passageway, a few minutes latter two Metropolitan Police officers arrived on site also. At approximately 22:40hrs the Customer was then taken upstairs

A gentleman approached me on the North Gate line, complaining about the long walk from the Piccadilly line to the Hammersmith and City lines, and how it wasn't signposted. I explained that if you are on the westbound Piccadilly line platform, if you walk to the top of the platform, there are a set of escalators leading towards the H&C line. I also mentioned that there are signs clearly directing you towards the Met, H&C lines. 

The gentleman was adamant that I was wrong, and I advised him as he is at the gate line level, he can touch out, and follow the signs towards the H&C, and touch back in as it will be a free interchange to the other side. He then began shouting and screaming at me saying that he shouldn't have to pay twice to get to the Hammersmith line. I calmly explained that he will not get charged, as he is still in the same station, it will be classed as a free interchange. 

He continued to shout abuse, and at this point I had pressed the personal alarm on my handheld radio as I felt threatened. The gentleman continued to shout and swear, and he was in my face, preparing to spit at me. I repeatedly told the gentleman to step back and to please calm down.

The individual had left at this point and headed towards the tube gate line, I apologised for pressing the red button and this is where LUCC asked the holder of radio 72247 to contact auto number 1800. I spoke to LUCC and they checked if I was okay and if I still required Police assistance, which they were in the process of arranging. I advised them that it wont be necessary as the individual has left the vicinity. 

At this point I ended the emergency transmission and contacted the control room advising that I had activated my personal alarm on my radio, they checked if I was okay and I said I think i will be fine but I need a few minutes to compose myself. 

The control room then contacted me again to advise the SOO had been in touch and they wished to speak to me. I advised the control room that I will contact the SOO after my meal relief. I spoke to the SOO, and she said she wanted to check if I was okay, and wanted to reassure me that my actions of activating the personal alarm was completely fine.","Threat","","CSA2","","","","","","","","","","","",5,"","","Male became aggressive due to the layout and signage on the station","UK_IRF001286189","",20230808

15:10 - CSA SF on the paid side of the gate line, standing by the exit WAG visually sees an assailant that is due to go court relating to a previous matter (see IRF001248422). The assailant is standing by the boswick gate nearby exit 3 staring at CSA SF in an intimidating look, one hand down his trousers whilst on the phone. The assailant approaches CSS JP who is situated by the paid side, nearby CSA SF in a rude, aggressive manner and requests to speak to CSS JP in private (CSS JP at that time is unaware of the court proceedings relating to the assailant and CSA SF). 

15:15 - CSS JP and the assailant are now in deep conversation. CSA SF remains in the same position and switches on his BWC. During the conversation between CSS JP and the assailant, CSA MO approaches CSS JP and alerts him to not engage in the conversation due to issue between the assailant and CSA SF.

During the conversation between CSS JP and the assailant, CSA SF left the gate line to the control room as the behaviour of the assailant was becoming more animated and his tone more confrontational therefore, CSA SF went to place of safety to reduce the tension. The assailant mentioned to CSS JP that ""I should get my family to follow him home after work"", of which CSS JP immediately rebuked and shortly after received a phone call from BTP relating to a separate matter. Once inside the control room CSA SF switches off the BWC and alerts CSM BN who is inside the control room, of the situation. CSM BN leaves the control room to speak to the assailant who is still in conversation with CSS JP. Once CSM BN arrives CSS JP departs. The assailant now admits to CSM BN of the pending court proceedings and mentions he comes to Vauxhall to visit family. Moreover, he went to length discussing his dissatisfaction of CSA SF's interaction in the previous time. The assailant now enters the paid side and travels downstairs.","Verbal","","CSA1","","","","","","","","","","","",5,"","","The assailant was previously reported to the BTP on the 04/03/2023 (see IRF001248422) due to acts of aggression and intimidation on the gate line to CSA SF.

2330 Hours CSM AM was making their way back from Station Entrance after directing customers to use Bank Station for Central line services when CSM AM approached gate line, CSA EG was talking to a male customer (suspect) and I was informed by CSA EG that they ned my assistance as there were a few customers who needed advice to continue their journey/s.","Verbal","","CSM2","","","","","","","","","","","",5,"","","I took this male to other side of Ticket Hall next to SCU, I was advised by customer that they were travelling to Waterloo and CSA EG advised customer to wait for myself to assist them.
The make then advised me that they missed their 2335 Hours train to Southampton, I then advised male to wait near control room window to see if I can find them an alternate route.
CSM AM went into office and checked on National Rail Enquiries for any other trains going to Southampton, unfortunately no train service was found and only services to Southampton resuming on Sunday Morning. I advised customer the details by using the speakerphone from inside control room, they then got very angry and started to verbally abuse me. By this time CSA EG then made their way into control room, I sympathised with the customer and advised that there is no other routes available for tonight and apologised for the delays to the District Line service. I then advised that any compensation for the delays can be dealt with by Customer Services. The male again started to verbally abuse me and added some swear words in punjabi (which I could understand). I again apologised and requested customer not to use this abusive language, they then told me ""that they will be waiting for me outside"" and began filming me on their personal phone.
Male then walked away and waited at Station entrance for approx 5 to 10 minutes. Upon this point for the safety of myself and my staff I called BTP on Auto 109, advised them of the situation and they advised a unit is on route.

When I arrived on the platform the male casualty was in the recovery position and was being tended to by a male who was a serving soldier. It was very busy and there was limited space. A second male was filming and was being told not to by at least two other customers.
As the casualty was stable and in good hands I liaised with the T/Op and then called the Met SC to update them on the situation. 
The male filming was becoming more of a problem and I presented myself as a barrier to protect the dignity of the collapsed male. He said he was asserting his right to film in a public place. I tried to reason with him about the dignity of the injured party and he began swearing and became aggressive. 
Customers continued to argue with him and as I was still on a call to Met SC I advised that we may need to detrain the train to ensure we could protect the dignity of the injured party and until we could ascertain the next best step.
At this point the male opened his eyes and the soldier myself and another member of the public assisted him off the train and onto the platform.
The train was further delayed from departing as 2-3 cars back from the incident car there was an unattended bag. I was in the process of applying the HOT procedure when the owner returned, it was the male who had been filming. I had words with him about the implications of leaving his bag unattended.
The customer (a Ukrainian national) was now fully alert and mobile, but appeared slightly impaired. He refused to give any details and declined any offers of assistance. He just wanted to travel to WPK.
I was reluctant to allow him to travel as I was concerned for him. The soldier who had been out in Ukraine built a rapport with him and offered to escort him to where he needs to go.

Why don't you do something about it"" to which I replied with ""We aren't allowed to, we get assaulted"". 

At this point he hurled abuse after abuse at me. 

He shouted/screamed:

""You fat cunt"" (3/4 times). 
""You 4 eyed prick"". 
That he was going to ""Cut/knock my head off"".
That ""I was going to get assaulted"". 
He stuck his fingers up swearing at me. 
And put his fingers in my face.
He said he was going to come through the gate. 
He went to open the side gate (towards me), but [witness CSA] closed it. 
As he was close to the side gate, swearing at me, he was spitting (from talking) at me. 

During the abuse I called for the ops room to make a call out for the BTP.

I’m a member of staff at Bond Street station. I was sitting in the Glap at the end of the shift, waiting for the last train to depart the station before locking up. A customer began to stare directly and intensely at me as he was exiting the gates. It was extremely uncomfortable. I asked if he needed assistance and he began to approach the Glap saying “did you say something to me”. He then began his harassment whilst standing in the doorway so I was unable to close the door and I felt trapped. He said things like “what I’m doing isn’t a crime”, “it’s a lose lose situation for you, you’re never going win”, “you’re here for public use” “you’re not in a strip joint”. As I’ve gone to pick up my work radio to ask for assistance from my management/colleagues he said “don’t worry im not going to touch you”. At this point I felt very unsafe and uneasy. As I called for assistance in a discreet way, he began to record me on his phone and when I asked why he was doing that he said “because you’re chatting shit”. As one of my colleagues approached, he began to walk away screaming and shouting out of the station and onto the street continuously shouting verbal abuse. The whole incident felt very purposeful and calculated like he knew what he was doing and know how to make someone feel uncomfortable and unsafe. I also verbalised I was feeling uncomfortable and that staring at someone the way he did is a form of harassment.","UK_IRF001290260","LU CCTV Evidence Tea",20230827

I told the caller that Becontree station has no disused platform but that the C2C platform on the WB is not in use. The caller (LIS) asked me to go and check.

I left the office and arrived at the platform, I did not see anyone on the C2C disused platform but I noticed that the TO (I think train 61), was going towards the metal barriers at the WB platform headwall, so I moved in that direction.","Physical","","CSS2","","","","","","","","","","","",6,"","","On arrival, I saw 2 males, hanging by the metal frames of the platform  barrier. One was asking for help, they were both hanging in a funny way but one of them requested help to move the other person from the metal barrier.

I checked and asked after their welfare. The one responding (the carer) said he cannot leave the other one, (patient) because he will run onto the tracks. The carer said this is his first time of talking the patient out as he is new to the family, hence he had no previous experience about the behaviour of the patient.

I tried to assist the carer to lose the patient’s legs from the metal barrier but it was difficult. The TO was asked to help too. We managed to get his legs off but could not get him onto the platform. We are on the tracks.

The DLC called and asked if I would advise him to run a safe train service but in cautious speed and approach to Becontree. I advised the DLC that train operations can continue in cautious speed and approach at Becontree station area. The TO then left us so he can move his train. The DLC also told me that the DRM is on the way.

I quickly called the CSMs office and update them on the situation at the station. I also called the DLC to request for the police when it became apparent that 2 of us cannot assuredly restrain the patient, who was not calming down but very agitated to let lose; the fear is that he would run unto either the C2C tracks or the LUL.

The DRM Ram arrived and he saw the situation; he was keeping the DLC/SM on the update. Patient was holding on to the legs of the DRM, not calming down. I was removing objects (stones and metal scraps) that could turn to weapon away from his reach.

CSM Ekobebe arrived on site.

As I was holding on to the patient, I could not answer some calls (phones/radios), but I did pick up a call from the LIS, I directed the LIS to speak to the DRM, so I don’t let go of the patient.

The mother and the sister of the patient arrived, both distressed, calling his name and all attempts to calm him down was abortive. The career and myself starts getting tired.

2 MET/BTP officers arrived. They quickly deploy and informed the mother that they will have to restrain the patient in handcuffs. They did but patient was still agitating to move, he was uttering verbal words all along but not coherent.

To move him from the track platform to the station platform, a train was used, with the DRM liaised with the DLC to get this arranged. The patient was then moved into the waiting room on the WB platform.

Further effort to calm him down was not yielding fruit. The police and the family met and decided to get him out of the station so he can get much help. DRM Ram was informed, he liaised with the DLC and a train arrived at the platform, it was used to block off the track. Patient was then carried by 6 MET/Police officers to the station concourse. The father arrived. After another 10 minutes of consultation, it was decided to move him into the police van. Patient was carried out of the station at exactly 18:39hrs.

Approximate time 18:50

Two children at exit WAG. One tapped the other out on a zip card who was clearly over 10. I made a comment that only children 10 and under were free on the tube as she clearly was not. 

The second child got stuck in the gate and I pressed the gate release button to allow her to walk through. The mother who had the clear intention to double behind was stuck on the paid side. I asked her to tap out or use a ticket. She said to me that she had her card, but stepped aside to allow other passengers to use the WAG. She then forced the WAG open giving me verbal abuse. 

The three left via Pelham street stairs. Moments later the mother came back down the stairs walking towards me. She got in my personal space shouting homophic assaults. I asked her to step back and she forcefully pushed me and then quickly started to walk away.

I then radioed CSS Underwood to call BTP and alerted him of the situation. He called me down to the control room.

We then started the BTP report.

He got very irate when i told him that he was not able to travel for free and that he cannot just leave his bag on the station as this was a security risk.  He started calling me a ""PUSSY HOLE""  and many other expletives.  I told him that if he did not calm down, i would call the police.  He did not, even taking off his jacket and inviting me outside.

I eventually took his bag to him to avoid any further escalation.  He was still not happy, he kept swearing so i put the bag down and went back into the control room.  He showed me his Ring and said that myself all my young Kids would die(i have no young kids)

T/Op was relieved at Harrow on the Hill for a fact finding interview. T/Op stated that he requested a Personal Needs Relief (PNR) on his southbound journey to Aldgate but, due to the Temporary Speed Restriction (TSR) at Wembley Park, the Service Controller instructed the T/Op to reverse at Moorgate for his booked N/B working. Upon arrival at Moorgate, T/Op went to use the toilet and made his way to the old CSS’s office. He used the buzzer a few times and eventually a male member of staff came out of the toilet. T/Op thanked the member of staff and asked for the door buzzer code for future use. Member of station staff replied that the T/Op is not allowed to use the toilet; nobody is allowed to use the toilet and they have been told not to allow anyone to use the facility. T/OP introduced himself that he is a Metropolitan Line train operator, and his train is in the platform. T/Op showed his staff pass to avoid confusion. 
When asked what happened next, T/Op stated that there was enough room between him and the staff member and so he went to the toilet and locked the door. He could hear the member of staff continually shouting for him to get out.
T/Op used the facility and came out the toilet and the member of staff was not there. T/Op Khan stated that he wanted to see the CSS to inform them of the incident and went to the gate line. The member of staff involved in toilet was present at the gate line. T/Op asked him his name for reporting purposes to which member of staff replied that he doesn’t need his name and he (T/Op) wasn't going to get it. T/Op then went to the CSS office and made the CSS aware of the altercation. Local CSS offered T/Op a cup of tea to which he politely declined.  
T/Op stated that the attitude of the member of station staff was intimidating and, although he himself is not easily intimidated, it appeared that that was the member of staff’s intention. He stated that the behaviour of member of staff was very bad. 
When asked to explain the bad behaviour, he stated that all he asked was to use the toilet which he is entitled to. He had offered to show his staff pass and still was met by intimidation. 

After having spoken to the CSS, T/Op returned to his train and spoke to the signaller and asked for a couple of additional minutes to compose himself. T/Op then carried on to HOH where he was due for a meal relief and welfare check by the local TM. 
T/Op stated that there was no physical threat or altercation and there was nothing else to add.

IRF - IRF001294212
Location Platform 1 – North end – 1st car
CSS Eastcote was informed about a VIP customer who was making her way back to Eastcote from Hyde Park Corner and that she would change at Rayners lane as the train was terminating at Rayners lane train 327.

CSS Dsouza then made her way to platform 1 to assist the customer who was on board train 470 from Rayners Lane. 

This is the same customer the CSS has assisted when the customer was on her way to Hyde Park Corner around 16:30 pm and made a log entry about her rude behaviour (as explained above in incident 1)

As informed, CSS went downstairs to platform 1 to assist the customer.
Train 470 arrived, and CSS assisted the customer outside the train. 
Customer was holding the dog’s leash in her right hand so CSS moved to the left side. CSS then informed customer that she was on her left. 
Customer them said ‘You need to be on my right’ (in a rude tone, whilst moving the dog’s leash to the left)

The customer asked if CSS Dsouza was the same lady who assisted her earlier.
 CSS said, ‘yes I did’.
 The customer started shouting at CSS Dsouza about earlier. 
At this point they were close to the train and platform 
So, CSS asked her to move to the side so they could speak if they customer has any preferences etc while getting onto the train. 
Customer said ‘you listen to me’ in a loud voice screaming.
Customer said, ‘Do not hold me like this, she was also putting allegations on me that CSS pushed her into the train earlier, which is not true’ (You could check CCTV for this) At this point as she was screaming and didn’t want to speak to the CSS appropriately.

CSS informed her ‘Maam I’m not going to continue speaking with you if you speak to me like this. 
I did not push you I was trying to help I even spoke to the T/OP to assist you at Hyde Park corner.

All other customers staring at us at this point.

CSS informed the customer that she did not push the customer at all. The Customer continued screaming whilst holding the CSS by her left forearm and flung it in an aggressive way.

CSS told the customer this is not right. 
Meanwhile another passenger stepped in who was standing there all along (Name – Christine Mckenzee contact 07904181973) 
Christine stepped in and said ‘That’s not the way to speak, the lady is trying to help you’ Christine also asked the lady if she could help her as the VIP left the CSS and wanted to walk by herself up the stairs.

CSS walked behind the VIP customer up the stairs and informed the VIP that the gates were open for her to pass. 

CSS- Honestly, if the other customer wouldn’t step in, CSS doesn’t think the VIP customer would stop with the aggression.
Chirstine was willing to be a witness to the assault and gave me her details. Christine also observed the VIP customers behaviour and stated that if a white person was dealing with her the approach would be completed different. Christine also said that the CSS should make a complaint to a team that deals with dignity at work.
Christine did really help calm the CSS down.

VIPs name as heard from other CSS is Linda. They also told CSS that the VIP customer has done similarly in the past","Physical","","CSS2","","","","","","","","","","","",6,"","","CSS was assaulted by a VIP customer","UK_IRF001294225","",20230907

I then activated the office mic only to hear a heated exchange between the customer and CSA to which I activated my camera 255610 then verbally asked both parties if everything was ok. I was ignored as the exchange continued so I exited the office to further investigate only to hear the customer tell the CSA that he will bring 11 men and beat him up. CSA continued to respond to the customer and I immediately asked CSA to stop. He did shortly after. The customer still holding onto the bag was then approached by what looks like his friend who took the bike off him and proceeded to the exit. This aided in distracting the customer who then turned around to leave but before doing so, stated to me 'you are a witness, he's calling me broke'!!!

Rci [PERSONAL DATA REDACTED] completed the report for fare evasion but we had concerns over the address supplied by the male . The Male is known from a driving licence he supplied as Mr [PERSONAL DATA REDACTED] with a date of birth of[PERSONAL DATA REDACTED]. The address is supplied was in east London with a postcode of [PERSONAL DATA REDACTED] , but he himself at the end of the interview stated that he doesn’t get post there , this led us to believe that the address was not his current address and that he did in fact live in the Buckhurst Hill Area , he denied this and Rci [PERSONAL DATA REDACTED] then viewed CCTV and obtained many days of CCTV proving that [PERSONAL DATA REDACTED] was using Buckhurst Hill station daily and not paying the full and correct fare.

On Monday 21st August a female who we also had under observation whom we originally thought was unconnected to him , but later found on CCTV was travelling with him on some days , went to London Bridge and roughly 8 hours apart bought 2 new oystercards (HERS – [PERSONAL DATA REDACTED] HIS – [PERSONAL DATA REDACTED])  both loaded with fresh zone 1 and 2 weekly travelcards again .

Both [PERSONAL DATA REDACTED] and this as yet unknown female then continued to use these respective oystercards to continue to offend on the LU network.

Using payment card data we can see that [PERSONAL DATA REDACTED] then bought yet another new Oystercard on the Monday 28th August 2023 at Newbury park station (Zone 4) , yet again with a zone 1 and 2 travelcard numbered [PERSONAL DATA REDACTED].

Our preferred Modus operandi for stopping and gaining a more trusted address for both suspects was to attend Buckhurst Hill station on Friday 8th September and make observations primarily for the female and then stop and interview her, myself and Rci [PERSONAL DATA REDACTED] arrived on Buckhurst hill station at around 0640 hrs and made our presence known to the station supervisor. 

We had an expected ETA for the female of around 0720 , and due to the nature of being in plain clothes we refained from putting on our TfL labelled Bodyworn video camera’s until just shortly before this time , unfortunately due to the nature and speed of which the incident took place no BWV footage is available.

YP1 rides the bike through Exit WAG 22  and parks the bike. Both YP's then enter Bridges store.

CSA1 is then seen to walk over to the parked bike and attempt to remove it from the premises as riding bicycles and bicycles that large are not permitted on the premises. YP1 & 2 then intercept CSA1 to prevent him from doing so, a brief struggle thereafter. CSA1 attempts to prevent YP1 & 2 entering any further into the station and onto down escalator 3, however he is unable to. 

[1732] YP1 & 2 take the bicycle down on the Esc 3. CSA1 activates top diamond to prevent an accident as there were multiple members of the public using Esc 3. I (duty CSM - duty CN02) then hear a loud bang from the ticket hall. It then came to light that this was the attempts of YP 1 & 2 to get the bike further down Esc 3. The 2 youths eventually reach the lower concourse area at which point YP1 mounts the bike and rides along Plt 1 E/B, YP2 makes his way down Plt 2 I believe.

I this point after several attempts to convince the youths that bikes of that kind are not aloud on the station and that the train will be requested to remain on the platform until they remove the bike to no avail, I contacted the Pic Line Service Controller to advise of the incident.

[1735] I requested that the controller bring trains in at caution speed owing to YP1 riding along Plt 1 E/B and Plt 2 W/B from an auto phone at Plt 1 E/B Headwall. CSA1 at the same time went onto Plt 2 W/B in order to be ready to speak to the driver of the next train in on that Plt (T322). 

Once driver of T322 held the train, I spoke with the 2 youths again who were in car 2 at which point they both exited the train but left the bike. I removed the bike whilst instructing CSA1 to begin inspecting Esc 3 for damage before assisting him to put it back into service.

Passengers on board car 3 had activated the alarm whilst at West Harrow due to a fellow passenger fainting and fitting on the floor of the train. 

The West Harrow CSS was tasked with attending, the PEA was reset but the CSS was unable to remove the passenger from the train. LAS had already been requested to attend by other passengers on the train, ref 2132.

The Service Controller requested the CSS travel on board the train with the person ill to Harrow where better assistance could be given, LAS were diverted to Harrow on the Hill.

The Metropolitan DRM and Harrow CSM were tasked with attending the platform. At 1251hrs, 433 arrived in p6 at Harrow where staff attempted to rouse the passenger who was still on the floor of the train but to no avail. 

The DRM requested the T/Op of 433 make announcements for passengers to use trains from platform 5 whilst 433 was held in platform 6. 

At 1300hrs, LAS were on site and attended to the passenger who came round in a few minutes and was brought to his feet. During the interaction time with the LAS, the male became very abusive towards them in general and further shouting racial abuse directly at one emergency services member. 

The CSS was able to build a rapport with the male and calm them down after they had previously been verbally aggressive in presence of all LUL staff and LAS staff at the incident. 

At 1304hrs, the DRM requested attendance of BTP via the Service Controller due to aggressive nature and racist language directed towards LAS staff. Ref 353.

The CSS was able to keep the passenger calm and took them to the waiting room on platform 5/6 until BTP arrival. LAS stated that they would remain on site whilst awaiting police so that they were able to keep a check over the male and to provide police with an account.

At 1322hrs, BTP were on site who took an account from the LAS member and further arrested the person who was taken off site by 1329hrs.

S 433 departed at 1314hrs and was subsequently reversed via Baker Street due to late running.

A 6 minute delay was recorded.","Physical","","CSS2","","","","","","","","","","","",6,"","","Person ill on train car 3 at West Harrow - person was collapsed on the floor and fitting and so decision taken by S/Controller to move train to Harrow on the Hill where further assistance could be given.

LAS had been requested by other passengers on the train and so were diverted to Harrow on the Hill. 

Male was brought round and taken off of the train - root cause for illness was thought to be alcohol dependency by LAS, male believed to be homeless.

Further, the male became abusive and aggressive in the presence of LU and LAS staff directing racial abuse towards one member of LAS staff in particular. DRM further requested BTP attendance due to persons behaviour who further arrested the male on attendance. LAS remained on site for the duration and gave an account to police on arrival.

It was also later established that whilst on the train with the PIOT, the CSS was assaulted by the passenger. Details given to the responsible CSM who has completed EIRF 1295805, WASSAB 3076808 refers. CSM has carried out duty of care towards CSS involved.

While going down escalator 5 there was a small dog with no owner or no lead at the bottom of escalator 6 looking up the escalator, a PA was made by CSS Williams for the owner to attend. When I reached the bottom a white male customer had picked the dog up, but he said he was not the owner but said he would take it upstairs. As he stepped onto the escalator a black male about 50 yrs, slim, shaved head, light blue jumper, blue jeans and white trainers identified himself as the dog owner to the white male carrying the dog. I asked if the male was owner and he said it was his sons. I asked if he had a lead which he said was on the platform in a bag. I asked him if he could put the dog on the lead as it was dangerous for the dog. The male said he was going to the toilet and kept saying he was a bus driver and flashed a pass (not TfL) with the name Wayne Garfield. The male very quickly became aggressive and raising his voice. He kept moving towards me and I asked him a number of times for him to step back. The male continued shouting and came within inches of my face.

As CSM GN03 pulled across the Bostwick gate situated by the computer room and inspected Switch Room (E5), a black male passenger was attempting to force his way through WAG22 on the paid side.  

The black male spots CSM GN03 then asks to let him 'in'. CSM GN03 enquired from the customer what he meant by letting him in? The male customer responded that, at the start of his journey he did not touch in. CSM GN03 asked which station he started from, and he replied ‘Kings Cross’ he added that he did not want to be overcharged if he touched out.  

CSM GN03 advised him to touch out and that she will resolve the journey. He replied with a short and aggressive “no!” CSM GN03 sensed that the male would become more aggressive, so she proceeded to the Sprinkler Valve Chamber to continue with her station checks and to remove herself from the situation. The black male passenger was not happy with that, stating that he had been disrespected by CSM GN53 by her moving away. After coming out of the Sprinkler Valve Chamber, the male had remained in the same position and immediately started shouting at CSM GN03 becoming even more threatening and confrontational, walking directly up into her face. Black male passenger also stated to CSM GN03 that the next time she disrespected him, he would deal with her later. He further mentioned that black women do not have respect. CSM GN03 activates Body Worn Camera 240432 and remained silent in response to the black male passenger’s rage and was really afraid for her safety.

Metropolitan Line services routed via the Southbound Local Line between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Wembley Park were delayed in consequence.

At 23:08 the Customer Service Supervisor (CSS) that had completed the late shift at Northwick Park station was approached by two members of the public whilst walking up the stairs from the ticket hall to Platforms 1 and 2, and then subjected to an unprovoked verbal assault by one of these individuals, an IC3 male of approximately 25 years of age. The CSS attempted to diffuse the situation but was then spat at by the male, who had taken a sip from a bottle of water in their possession to ensure that the CSS was soaked with what the male described as ""holy water"". The male then proceeded to throw the remaining contents of the water bottle at the CSS.

This assault was witnessed in part by the CSS commencing a night shift at Northwick Park, who recorded events from their perspective with a Body Worn Video camera, and was subsequently reported to the Metropolitan Line Service Controller by the Train Operator of S464, with whom the CSS took refuge. The alleged assailant and their companion were observed standing on Platform 2 by the T/Op whilst they passed report to the Controller, and they were instructed to depart Northwick Park before the assailants boarded the train in order to separate them from the CSS. The train duly departed Platform 2 for Preston Road at 23:13, after an initial service delay of 5 minutes.

It was initially believed that the alleged assailant and their companion had boarded the following train, S473, so this was held upon its arrival  into Wembley Park Platform 5 at 23:19 to facilitate a search of the train by British Transport Police (BTP) officers deployed to Wembley Park for this purpose. No persons matching the description of the assailant and their companion were located, and the train was therefore permitted to depart for Finchley Road after a short delay. It was subsequently ascertained that the two persons in question had exited Northwick Park station via the entrance to Northwick Avenue at 23:14.

Duty of care activities in respect of this incident were carried out by the Wembley Park Customer Service Manager (CSM), who spoke with the CSS after they had alighted from S464 at Wembley Park to assist BTP with their search of S473. Trauma Support Group assistance was not however extended to the CSS because they had indicated that they just wanted to get home following the conclusion of their duty and subsequent assault. 

The CSS assailant has been described as an IC3 male of 25 years of age, who was wearing a black jacket, black trousers, black shoes and a black hat. They were estimated to be around 6 feet one inch tall. Their companion, who had attempted to restrain them during the assault, was described as a female of about 5 feet and three inches in height, who was wearing a beige jacket. The male was noted to have tapped into the wide aisle gate at Northwick Park station shortly before the assault using their smart phone so it may be possible to identify them from the data recorded.","Threat","","CSS2","","","","","","","","","","","",7,"","","S464 was delayed departing Northwick Park Platform 2 for Preston Road whilst incident responders dealt with the unprovoked assault of a member of London Underground staff.

That the same rules apply to everyone it was the fire regulations following the Kings Cross Fire where 31 people died and why does he think that it was ok for just him to break the rules and put other people’s safety in danger. When he did not get the reaction, he was hoping for from the other passengers he became more abusive and threatening to me.

I made it look that, a security check was being carried out, by checking the non public doors were locked closed.

I then left via the automatic door, and they screamed ""oih"" at me again.

At no point had I entered into any conversation with either of them, their body language felt aggressive, and they just wanted trouble.

Feeling threatened, I made my way back to the Station Office.  One individual in a black shirt was following me.

After entering the Station Office, my foot was against the door whilst I was closing the door, it was then double locked.

Shortly afterwards, the male in the black shirt started kicking at the Station Office door.

Finchley Central station supervisor had previous reported a disturbance involving 2x aggressive males.

Following initial reports of antisocial behaviour in the southbound platform waiting room, the station supervisor discreetly carried out a station check. Upon entering the waiting room, he was immediately subjected to unprovoked aggression to the extend that he felt the need to retreat to the supervisor's office for his own safety.

At this point one of the males followed him and started banging on the door of the supervisor's office. Both males then boarded S12 and travelled to East Finchley.

Upon arrival at East Finchley a further disturbance occurred with the males now stating a passenger had kicked their dog.

After this disturbance subsided, S12 departed, however at this point the two males then started following the East Finchley station supervisor, who like her colleague also felt the need to retreat to the supervisor's office for her own safety.

At 23:06 BTP on side. A search was carried out however the males could not be located.

High Barnet group station management will follow up duty of care arrangements towards the staff concerned, the the incident will be further investigated by British Transport Police.

CSS spoke to the customer but was not listened too and then the passenger stepped off the train once more, during this time the T/Op closed the doors and moved off on a green signal.

The male was very angry at this point and walked towards the exit stairs. The CSS then found him in the ticket hall trying to re-board another train, but the CSS mediated with him and calmed the male down, after having a conversation the male apologised for his behaviour and explained he has mental health problems and that he has nothing against the TFL staff and that he is grateful for them trying to get him home.

The female whom they were waiting for then having gotten close to the gates told them not to worry that she has her pass. Both males then left the paddles of the gate alone and make their way out with the female.
I watched them as they left. The white male then asked me in an angry tone ""What are you looking at?"" and I responded that I was look at him for holding the gate open. He then said to me that if I looked at him that way that he would ""smash my face in"". I activated my body worn camera (number 256599) which caused him to say ""go ahead and activate your camera"". He uttered some other words that I did not quite hear. The black male who was with him also mumbled some intelligible words too as he walked away. They eventually departed crossing the road in front of the station and heading down towards the right-hand side.
The CUBIC technician witnessed their actions and heard what was said. I was delayed by another customer query before I was able to go into the office to report the incident to the British Transport Police.
I have seen both males and the female on a regular basis, they are regular fare evaders that force their way through the WAG and have done this on a number of occasions in the past week where they stand using their bodies to keep the paddles open while they allow others to either enter or exit. They have at times come through the station multiple times in  a day. I have seen them exit at DAGEHNAM EAST station too.

The first male is a white male, 5feet 10 inches tall, slim build, aged between 40 and 50years old, shaven head, wearing glasses, white T-shirt, black jogging bottoms, dark trainers and carrying a black medium sized rucksack.
The second male is a black male, 6feet tall, slim build, short unkempt hair facial hair, aged between 35 and 40years wearing a dark T- shirt and grey jogging bottoms.

UPON my at approximately 17:15 I entered the station via the exit 6 stairway and was confronted by a male (Black male 5.11, slim build age approximately 19, short black hair wearing all black clothing) who ran straight into me knocking me over. He was pursued by a male and female Police officer who was attempting to arrest the male in question.
Upon being knocked over the male stamped on my elbow he was resisting arrest and had the upper hand of to two officers. The female officer was shouting at the male to stop resisting, but the male kept fighting. I could see the officers were getting hurt so I assisted the officers in detaining the male. He resisted and we all fell a couple of stairs downwards. I hit my head on the blue handrail and also landed on my left elbow grazing it, my back and my knee. My face got scuffed in the scuffle between the male and police. I was told to move out the way as the male got to his feet and was still resisting. The officers took him to the floor again. I ran downstairs to get more officers to assist. All officers were busy. Eventually two other officers ran over, I directed them to the scene quickly.

At this time, I received a radio call from the control room informing that they were observing a member of public laying on the floor of the SOUTH BRIDGE which is an area of the station which is currently closed to the public.
My colleague CL and I made way to check on the passenger. When we arrived, I observed a person I would describe as a MALE, appeared to be of INDIAN appearance, in his late 40’s, 5ft 11 tall, average build, medium length BLACK GREYING hair, light facial hair, wearing BLACK shoes, BLACK combat style trousers and KHAKI GREEN hooded jacket with hood up, rolling about on the floor, so my colleague CL first asked him to get up however he ignored her request. I then asked him to get up to which he responded by stating, I WILL PUNCH YOU WHEN I GET UP. I then informed him that I was going to call the police and I made my way to the manager’s office where I requested police attendance. BTP ref 076 01.10.2023 was given.
Whilst awaiting police attendance, I was informed through my colleague CL that INDIAN MALE, had got up on and was walking towards EASTBOUND PLATFORM. I then made my way back to my colleague who was still at SOUTH BRIDGE part of the station where we followed INDIAN MALE to the EASTBOUND PLATFORM. Once we were on the PLATFORM, I observed INDIAN MALE towards the HEADWEALL side of the platform, rolling on the floor, under a platform seat. I requested for my colleague CL to return to the control room, to request a male member of staff to assist. One of the Customer Service Assistants EW (BB47) came down to the platform to assist as I needed to use the toilet. Whilst on my way there, I received a radio call from my colleague on the platform informing me that INDIAN MALE had now gone beyond the platform end barrier and was laying on the other side of the barrier. I immediately returned to the platform where my colleague AA (BB49) was conducting his 5pm station check. At 05:15hrs I arrived and INDIAN MALE got up and walked down the PLATFORM END RAMP and which is considered to be trackside. At this point, 05:15hrs I requested to the PICCADILLY SERVICE CONTROLLER to switch all power off due to a trespasser on the track. I began to request for INDIAN MALE to return to the platform however INDIAN MALE ignored my request and began to walk on the tracks onto the EASTBOUND DISTRICT LINE track. INDIAN MALE began walking back and forth between EASTBOUND DISTRICT LINE track EASTBOUND PICCADILLY LINE track.
I then observed INDIAN MALE climb onto the signal post and he requested for us to let train run. INDIAN MALE then came down from the signal post and lay back down on the PLATFORM END RAMP. At 05:28hrs BRITISH TRANSPORT POLICE OFFICERS arrived and hand cuffed INDIAN MALE. I then updated the PICCADILLY LINE CONTROLLER that INDIAN MALE was under control of the BTP OFFICERS and trains could now run at caution speed. At 05:33hrs trains began to run again at caution speed. 05:48hrs more BTP OFFICERS arrived to assist. At 05:57hrs, BTP officers escorted INDIAN MALE from the platform and into their police van.
PICCADILLY CONTROLLERR was then contacted to resume normal service as the platform areas was now clear.","Physical","","CSA1","","","","","","","","","","","",7,"","","Trespasser on the eastbound local and fast.","UK_IRF001301053","",20231002

I explain to the customer because of health and safety bikes need to be folded around the station also.
the customer continues to argue and pushing his point - I explain that unfolded bikes are not allowed on the station or train and if he don't fold it he will be refused travel. 
The customer took his phone out and started filming saying we were wrong and he was going to complain, At this point I started my own BWV. 
I took my time again to explain the conditions of carriage and said if he folded his bike he could travel. 
Eventually the customer folded his bike and used WAG 21   to enter and as soon as he was through unfolded his bike again.
Myself and the CSA stopped the customer and again said he could not travel with an unfolded bike.
the customer started to raise his voice in an attempt to make a scene in front of a crowd of others waiting for a lift - but to his dismay they all turned on him and said he was in the wrong and everyone folds there bikes.
As I could see we were getting nowhere I requested the CSA call the BTP.
There was more back and forth between myself explaining my reasons and health and safety concerns and the customer saying the TFL website says fold bikes on trains only.
In the end the customer folded his bike and went to the platform level but stated we haven't seen the end of this and he will return tomorrow.
BTP advised - they will be taking a statement and try to be on site for the next day.","Verbal","","CSM2","","","","","","","","","","","",7,"","","Customer trying to manipulate the wording of the TFL website when it clearly states ""You can take folded cycles anywhere, at any time on all our transport services"" he is saying that means you can take an unfolded bike around the stations but need to fold them on the trains only.","UK_IRF001301420","",20231003

The above named train operator made a MAYDAY call to NSCC to report the incident and to request Traction Current to be switched off.
A Category 1 incident was declared and an Incident Talk group was established on Incident Channel 27 (PUT).
Short Circuiting devices were placed at both ends of the train and the Jubilee Line was suspended from Stratford to North Greenwich in both directions.
The body was located under unit 96121 (car 1) on the South side (driver's side), and was confirmed as life extinct.
The above named Network Incident Response Manager and Duty Reliability Manager were sent to site to deal with the incident.
ERU, BTP, LFB and LAS were also in attendance. An assisting train operator was sent from North Greenwich (526 Duty) to operate the train as required to deal with the incident and then onwards to SMD.

The delay was exacerbated by DLR failing to co operate with LUL staff.

The undersigned even arranged for the DLR Captain (there were 2 on board) to contact their controller, but the controller also refused the request. This resulted in the undersigned having to go to West Silvertown and catch a bus to near Canning Town Station and then walk the remaining distance due to the road being closed as a result of the incident.

Due to a predicted late ONA on T262 within an EDW RD Depot duty, the MET Service Controller advised the T/Operator on T262 to detrain it at Goldhawk Road westbound and stable the train at Hammersmith Sidings.

As the T/Operator started detraining at Goldhawk Road, a customer sitting in the last carriage refused to get off the train inspite of being advised that another train was just behind.  She verbally abused the T/Operator and yelled at him, ""Fucking idiot! go back to Africa"", and other expletives.  Train Operator left the customer in the carriage and went back to his Di=river's Cab where he informed the MET Service Controller who advised him to take the train to Hammersmith station platform instead, which he did.

Train Operator arrived at Hammersmith and also informed the desk Trains Manager of what happened before proceeding to his booked meal relief..  After his meal relief, he then alerted the desk TM at Hammersmith depot that he was a bit shake hence unable to operate his next T274 eastbound to Barking.  Duty of care was given before the T/Operator was sent to Barking to be seen by his TM.

At Barking, a welfare check was carried out on the Train Operator and duty-of-care given.  He was asked if he was still shaken but said he was fit enough to drive his car back home.  He was then sent home and advised to inform the Barking desk once he got home safely.

Train Operator has been passed the details of LU Employee Assistance as part of the Management Duty-of-Care.  He is on rest-days Friday and Saturday 6th & 7th October prior to proceeding to a 2-weeks annul leave.

The BTP was also contacted about this incident and a crime reference number: 5/10/084 generated over it.

At 12:24 hrs, the C&H Line T274 re-entered passenger service from Barking westbound platform and continued until booked as stable at 00:42 BKG SDGs.
This cancellation on T274 did cause a 5-minute delay to the C&H Line service.

This female does not pay for her travel.
I approached the mother who was ignoring me and she and her family boarded train 324. As the train was not leaving for another 2-3 minutes i decided to approach her and tell her that after our conversation yesterday and two weeks ago, where i continually informed her that she must pay for her daughter to travel, she told me to talk to her daughter as she was the one not paying. I informed her that as she is the parent and that she was allowing her child through using her oystercard then it was her i wanted to talk to.
The female became quite aggressive toward me raising her voice saying she had no money to pay for her. 
I informed the female that i would be reporting the matter to the correct authorities as she has ignored my pleas for her to pay for her daughter and as i started to walk along the Platform i heard her tell me to Fuck off and call me racist.
I asked her not to swear at me and at no point had i been rude to her or raised my voice, but she continued to swear at me again.
At this point I walked away from them to avoid things escalating and allowed her to travel on TN324.
I then contacted the BTP to inform of the incident.
At 11.30 i was asked to speak to a female at the door to the Control room.
I approached the female and asked how i could help her. This female was quite aggressive in her manner and accused staff of harassing some people that she knew. I informed her that it was me that had spoken to the lady earlier on, to which i was interrupted by the female and asked why i was harassing her. i asked the female who she was before answering and she replied she was an advocate for the family.
I explained that they young lady that had travelled with her mother must pay for her journey, I was then interrupted again as the female said , ""they have ordered a new oystercard for her and that why is i am the only person trying to stop her? At Kings Cross they have said it's fine and all over London the staff have said it's ok and nobody minds"". I explained that  would not be the case as everybody that should pay is supposed to pay. The young female became quite aggressive and started filming me at which point i switched BWC256036 on.
One of my colleagues attempted to explain and the female told him to shut up. At that point I informed her that I would no longer talk to her and made my way back into the office. As she walked away she said me and my brother will coming with them tomorrow morning and my colleague asked if that was a threat to which she replied ""Yes it is"".

Below is a statement taken from the CSA in his own words:

""A member of Greater Anglia staff around 16:05pm on 06/10/2023 approached me at the B way out main gate line at Liverpool Street Underground station re his bearer pass. I’m not based at Liverpool Street Underground station so I’m unaware of changes to bearer passes etc. I’ve known it to be not valid as the route is taken on the mainline concourse. I was told after supposedly it’s changed. I told the member of Greater Anglia staff that it’s not valid. The member of Greater Anglia staff became aggressive, got in my face and shouting with waving his hands around. The member of Greater Anglia staff abused me and called me a ""prick"". I do not deserve this whilst I am at work. I do not come to work to be abused. When asking the member of Greater Anglia staff why they called me the abusive name they could not answer. The member of Greater Anglia staff then went up to another member of London Underground staff in the middle of the gate line to be let through. Then waving his hands around aggressively to that member of London Underground staff to which he was saying things about myself. This is totally unacceptable.""

16:45 - CSS JT attended the NR office and spoke to the GA manager. According to the GA manager, the member of staff as described by the CSA does not work at the station. It is likely that he works either at another station or is revenue control staff as he alluded to this during his interaction with the CSA.

16:55 - CSA was taken to the BTP office on platform 10 to make a formal allegation. Two BTP officers  attended and viewed CCTV at around 18:20 - They have stated that this will likely not be recorded as a crime as it occurred between two staff and was not aggravated.","Verbal","","CSA1","","","","","","","","","","","",7,"","","Verbal altercation between LU CSA and a Greater Anglia member of staff travelling through the station.","UK_IRF001302106","",20231006

CSS DT and DCEM AG made way to the female. 
Approx 14:21 hours CSS DT and DCEM AG assisted two female who were struggling to restrain a large female. 
CSS DT and DCEM AG then got hold of the large female’s arms to help in restraining her. (Large female will be referred as Suicidal female). 
One of the females was an off-duty detective police officer for the Met police (will be referred as Met DC) and the other female was the large females Support worker from the hospital (will be referred as Support worker).
The Met DC informed both DCEM AG and CSS DT that the suicidal female was under a mental health section.
At approx. 14:23 hours CSS DT and DCEM AG physically escorted the suicidal female to waiting room near costa coffee this was to ensure that the suicidal female, had no way to run away or to harm herself by means of running onto the tracks or train. 
Between the times of 14:23 hours and 14:40 hours CSS DT liaised with Central line controller on 903 via radio call function to request British Transport Police officers (will be referred as BTP) urgent assistance as well trains to come in restricted speed. Due to the suicidal female. During this time the suicidal female continually tried to escape the waiting room causing CSS DT, DCEM AG and Met DC to physically restrain the female to avoid her escaping and avoid her harming herself. During these struggles CSS DT was elbowed in the face during the struggle to restrain the suicidal female. 
At one point during the time CSS DT and DCEM AG were restraining the suicidal female she tried to activate the fire call point. CSS DT then made the decision whilst physically restraining the female to physically escort the suicidal female with the help of DCEM AG to the other side of the waiting room. This was done to avoid the suicidal female activated the fire call point alarm which could put the station into evacuation mode.
Force used by CSS DT was holding onto the females arms as well as body holding (like a large body hug) to ensure female didn’t escape or harm herself, CSS DT or DCEM AG or the Met DC.
During this time CSS DT also received multiple point to point radio call but when answering CSS DT informed the individual calling that CSS DT was unable to speak due to being hands on with the female
During this time LUCC radio point to point CSS DT on his radio to see what was happening CSS DT informed LUCC that BTP needed and that a off duty police onsite requiring immediate police assistance.
At approx. 14:40 hours British Transport Police officers arrived, and CSS DT updated the one of BTP police officers what the situation was and what occurred. 
CSS DT stayed with the x2 BTP police officers, suicidal female, Support Worker and DCEM AG as the female’s behaviour was escalating with the female continually trying to escape.

He tapped it on the MFM and said it has money on there he has just topped it up, I could also see the photo was deliberately defaced so asked him to hand me the card so I could try it on the gate and as I did I explained to him that the card has been cancelled most likely due to it being reported lost or stolen.
He said no he had just topped it up, I explained that the card does not belong to him and he should not be using it but he replied that the oyster card was his wife's card which was clearly not the case.
I said that was not the case and unless his wife was between the ages of 11-15 this is not his wife's card as this card belongs to a child and has clearly been deliberately defaced.
I asked him his name and he said Vitali which I pointed out was not the name on the card and he continued to explain that he has topped up the Oyster with £30 and showed me his Barclays account as proof he just topped it up with £30 but I explained again that the Oyster is for a child not an adult.
A customer at the machine tried to explain that the male was saying he topped up the card so I explained yes I know however I am not disputing the fact he topped it up with £30 I am saying that card should not be used and that he said it his wife's card but it belongs to a child so unless his wife was between the ages 11-15 then this is not hers.
I continued asking where he got the card from and explaining that the card should not be used by him.
Another customer came into the station and they seemed to be familiar with each other as they had acknowledged each other and he spoke with the customer who had just arrived.
This customer then began to explain so I said what the situation was and he tried to explain to him what I was saying by using translate however this was no good either, another customer came in this time speaking to him in his native tongue and again was questioning if I was keeping the card which I said yes because he is telling me that it was his wife's card but it belongs to a child so they customer smiled and said oh and walked off.

CSS MR reiterated if support is required such as EAP however for now CSA NS does not require assistance but will let us know if the situation worsens. CSS MR requested CSA NS to take frequent breaks, ensure he sits for more longer period of time and if he does feel more pain to return back to the control room. CSS MR will assess CSA NS health and if he is not fit for duty, CSS MR will cover the rest of CSA NS duty and send him home as duty of care.

He continued to speak and as i looked to my left there were also customers trying to ask questions and he insisted that i deal with them first and he will continue, i was shocked and worried because he then went on to say he wanted to do something about it while looking at me seriously. I asked him what he was talking about and then went to reach for my radio to alert LU1 about what was going on and as he saw that I was about to radio he turned away and ran towards the Western subway.

I asked the politely if that wouldn't mind leaving the train as it terminated here, I got no response so I gently went to shake the male to wake him up and remove his hood this is so I could see the male, he then went to grab my hand which I moved away and told me to leave him alone and not to fucking touch him he then went to go back to sleep.
12:20 I made my way off the train and back into the office where I contacted the controller on the auto phone i informed them of the situation, the controller told me to tell the driver to take the train in service to Loughton but not to reopen the doors here. I went out and spoke to the driver who took the train up to Loughton.","Threat","","CSS2","","","","","","","","","","","",8,"","","Males looked to be under the influence of ether drugs, alcohol or maybe even both.

A black male, dressed in all black came into the station with an un-foldable bike via Exit 7. 

After being told by CSA1 that this part of the network, unfolded bikes weren’t allowed as he approached entry gate 21, he was told the same again by CSM1. CSM1 even pointed to the poster depicting where on the network unfolded bikes could be taken. The male took umbridge to this as he was in a rush and began swearing and abusing CSM1 that we’d needlessly allowed him to top up his oyster card before telling him he couldn’t travel. We hadn’t had any interaction with the male prior to him approaching an entry gate as he had topped up his oyster card by himself. A person topping up their oyster card, even with an un-foldable bike, isn’t out of the ordinary as some people merely pass through the station. 

As the male became abusive, CSM1 switched on BWC 239366 and decided to walk away as the male wasn’t listening to reason. As CSM1 was walking away with the male having now threatened to assault CSM1, he barged his bike into the back of CSM1’s right leg and the proceeded to swear more and finally leave via Exit 2. 

BTP were informed with a reference of 702 of 20/10/2023 given. The male topped up his oyster card at 22:21 on MFM 30. BWC footage will be tagged.

On entering the mess room CSS NS and CSA QBP had found shattered glass with blood on the mess room floor and a large hole in the mess room window.
CSS NS inspected the platform and found glass and blood near the bench, down the platform, through the ticket hall and out into the car park.
There was a large amount of blood in the car park, outside the rear of the cleaner's mess room.
The shop keeper (SKS) had informed CSS NS that the culprit and his accomplice had re-entered the station and asked SKS for tissue to clean his cut hand. SKS had informed the males that he could not give them tissue, but gave them a plastic bag to cover his wounded hand.
CSS NS called BTP non emergency line at 1640hrs, then eventually called BTP emergency line to report the incident.

She pretended as if she needed help but I could not work out easily what kind of help she needed as she made her voice inaudible. She sounded like I was the one who did not understand her as she used her body to block the WAG 22 exit gate. I asked her to step aside several times but then raised her voice to say, ""I was only being polite to you, you know"".

I truly did not get what she was implying as she could now be heard, saying, ""Come on, big guy, come on now. Come on, please"". So I ask her, ""Come on for what? What are you saying? What do you want?"" in the hope of getting her to explain herself to me clearly.
As she was now blocking the WAG 22, which prevented the users from exiting the station, I asked her to please move away from the gate. She was reluctant to do so but eventually did, after taking my name for being rude to her. She was the one being abusive towards me, though, for asking her to move to allow others to use the gate.  
After she had left my position, I later heard her raise her voice as she argued with my colleague by the top of the stairs to platforms 2 and 3. I intervened in the end by asking my colleague to move away from her to stop her continuous tirade of abuse.
I asked her why she was, again, having an argument with him. She replied that she had asked him to carry her bag and he had said he wouldn't. It was a small bag and she had it in her hand. The bag was small and did not look heavy and I told her so. She leaned into me and prodded me, saying ""because you are a big man, that is why it looks small”. She said I should have made him to carry her bag for her and that we were not gentlemen but (words I can't repeat). She then came towards me, used her body to prod me, again, as she uttered horrible abusive words against  me and my mother. Nasty words. There was no need for that. 
She continued being vulgar as I told her to mind her language as families were passing by. That now made her to be more insulting. I find it hard to repeat what she said about my parents regarding my existence. With that said, I told her to move away from me. I then informed her that her outburst towards me is not acceptable, and that staff are not there to be abused. 

I told her I saw as she easily carried around the bag with little or no effort. That was why I believed she was pranking us with her irrational behaviour,

She was then observed carrying her small bag to the platform 2 and 3.","Physical","","CSA1","","","","","","","","","","","",8,"","","A woman, who, I believed, was angry before getting into the station by an unknown reason, was behaving irrationally to staff and then became abusive, as she vented her anger towards us.","UK_IRF001307421","",20231024

He carried on in that way swearing. He didn’t give much opportunity for explanation as each times CSS AG addressed his concerns. He kept coming closer and closer to CSS AG’s face and then he said, ‘go and find out’. Each time CSS AG tried to explain the arrangements we made for customers to travel. He wasn’t happy with the alternate routes and options given by CS AG to the point where T077 was in the platform CSS AG pointed to it and asked him to board the train he refused. As CSS AG was trying to enter the office to get more details, the customer put his feet on the door. CSS AG told him that he can’t put his feet on the door and the customer blocked him with his body, So CSS AG asked him to step back which he did. At that point CS AG entered the office and closed the door. He proceeded to kick and hit the door vigorously.

CSA assessed situation and determined passengers were not just asleep, radioed for CSS assistance.
On arrival, CSS attempted to wake the passengers. Both passengers were breathing, but no response from speaking to them or shaking their leg. There was no sign of any resistance to their leg being shook.
CSS spoke to train operator and was going to move train to sidings and seek medical assistance. At this time, some members of public boarded the train and poured water on the 2 males, causing them to regain consciousness. The 2 male passengers were assisted off the train by the members of the public. CSS returned to the scene and the members of the public were saying the 2 males were in possession of stolen property, the bags did not belong to them. The 2 males were talking in another language and became hurried to leave the station. CSS and CSA were following them along the platform, as they were walking close to the edge and were somewhat unstable on their feet.
The 2 males attempted to board T303, at which point CSA1 tried to stand in the way and prevent them as they were unfit for travel. One of the males became very aggressive, pushed CSA1 and spat at CSA1 repeatedly. CSS got between the male and the CSA, pushed them apart and the passenger who spat kept attempting to get to the CSA and repeatedly spitting. The passenger was then dragged in to T303 by his friend. The doors closed and the train departed.

The CSS explained 2 males were on the train and appeared unconscious but breathing. They would not respond to any actions taken to wake them up. Arrangements were made for the train to be detrained and taken into the sidings with the Train Operator while the CSS planned to request an ambulance. Two male by-standers intervened and poured water over the males and this woke them up, however the by-standers seemed to observe the contents of their bags and accused them of theft. 

The 2 men tried to leave the station but were unsteady on their feet and appeared disorientated, a train pulled in on the Northbound and the CSA tried to explain they were not fit to travel in that state and was spat at and lunged at by one of the men. The CSS intervened as the customer was determined to assault the CSA, pushing and spitting continuously at him.

Eventually the men boarded train 303 Northbound and left the station.

The train which was detrained was able to depart with a delay of 6 minutes.","Threat","","CSA1","","","","","","","","","","","",8,"","","Customer action - staff assault.

The CSS requested BTP assistance, the saliva kit was used and the CSA was sent home. The CSM will refer both parties to the workplace violence unit for additional support.

Both Train Operators have been asked for memos in regards to witness statements and will be offered support by the local management team, who has been advised of them potentially witnessing the incident.

Trauma Support will be offered again when the CSM next speaks with the CSA.

The male came from the eastbound, approached the WAG22 and emptied his pockets on it. During this someone barged through the WAG22. He looked at both CSSs and then carried on looking for his oyster. As the male proceeded to tap out you could see that he was intoxicated.

- The male was heading to exit the station then turned around shouting about how he is a soldier. He stated that he is in the army earning £18,000 and earns less than us who earn £28,000. He kept shouting at us that we should be ashamed of ourselves earning more than a protector of their country, a soldier in the army. He carried on shouting at us, that we were both worthless women, that we don’t deserve to be here and in this job.

- Both CSSs were subjected to a continuous rally of verbal abuse, the words and phrases used were extremely offensive. The male then tried to get closer as both CSSs did not engage in conversation and were silent. The male started making offensive hand gestures and continued to verbally abuse both CSSs e.g our appearance, our weight and he stated the fact that as we were women, we should work as prostitutes whilst he as a man works in the army defending the country.

The initial details were that 2 male customers were fighting on the platform and it looked to the train operator (as reported by him) as though the larger of the two was going to throw the other one (his younger brother) onto the track into the path of the train.
The train was stopped 10 feet short of their relative position on the platform.
The above named CSS attended the scene and assisted. The all clear was given to NSCC by the CSS at 18:48 and train 323 was authorised to proceed in Protected Manual Mode to the correct stopping mark for 1996 TS.

The Service Manager requested the undersigned DRM to meet train 323 at Canary Wharf to provide a welfare check; unfortunately, the train operator did not acknowledge the DRM.

The undersigned DRM attended Kilburn Station and viewed the CCTV with the CSS. The following timeline of events was compiled using footage from Cameras 024 and 025:

18:43:26 2 Males on Platform 2, near the southbound end of the platform herb garden. One is said to be aged in his early 20s, the other is much smaller and estimated to be 13. The CSS discovered they were brothers.
18:44:29 The older brother grabs his younger brother as train 323 is approaching the platform on its northbound journey
18:44:33 323 enters the platform area, the customers are grappling, but squarely on the platform. They are not as far to the edge as the tactile paving.

The train operator reported a near miss incident. The undersigned DRM has determined from the CCTV evidence that this incident does not constitute a near miss incident for 2 reasons:

1. The 2 customers were on the platform throughout and did not get near the platform edge.
2. The train stopped 10 feet short of the customers, as stated in the train operator's memo (attached)

The behaviour of the 2 customers did not strike the undersigned DRM as particularly unusual.
The train operator was involved in another incident earlier in the week with trespasser on the track (EIRF 1309769 refers)
The undersigned DRM recommended to the TM on duty at Wembley Park that if the train operator needs assistance to regain resilience then TSG should be offered.

Gentleman came asking for directions to McDonald’s.

I saw dealing with two other passengers, he became abusive as I didn’t answer his question straight away
told him the direction of upstairs you’ll see it
he came back smashed his hand on the glass of the flap and started screaming at me.  why are you not helping me
I told him I was not going to help, he then pressed the help point, and I assume spoke to CSS.
he then came back again and was still shouting.

********** Statement from CSS NC whom attended from LST to the BGT ticket hall **********

Approx. 08:30, I attended the Broadgate gate line after hearing CSA TC on the MGT radio saying she was being filmed. When I arrived, the male was not there, but I spoke to CSA TC and she provided me the below details.

A male pushed in between two customers that she was assisting saying “Where is McDonald’s?”, she asked him to wait as she was busy helping two other customers (at this time the 2 other CSA’s were re-setting escalator 16 which had stopped). He was very rude, but CSA TC explained to go up the escalators and McDonald’s was behind him. He left and came back very angry and started filming her saying she wasn’t helpful and where is Mc Donald’s. She again said to go up the escalators and it’s behind you, he then aggressively started banging on the GLAP glass which is when she radioed the Control Room. He then pressed the call point and spoke to the SOR.

Whilst telling me the above the male came back and asked to speak to a supervisor, so I identified myself and he began telling me that CSA TC had given him wrong directions to Mc Donald’s, so I again said to go up the escalator and it would be behind him. He told me I was wrong, and that the escalators are indoors, so I assumed he then meant the escalators from NR at LST, so I started to say he hadn’t said he wanted that specific exit to which he replied “I want to speak to someone higher than you, you are not God” I said there was no one else available at the moment, and he started filming me asking for my name. I gave him my name, and he took a picture of my name badge. And he left.

After he left, CSA PF and CSA IK arrived and CSA IK said he was the same male that was rude to him, on the same gate line asking for Mc Donald’s yesterday.

When I started to explain to him that it would be easier to take the bus, he started shouting something and opened the barriers with a freedom pass. He started calling me names, swearing and following me wherever I went. Was difficult to understand because I believe he is a mentally sick person.

A white male, scruffy in appearance approached the exit Wide Aisle Gate where CSA MM and CSS SI were stood. Once he passed through the gate, completely unprovoked, he began abusing CSA MM calling her amongst other things, a ‘fucking terrorist’ and of ‘trying to incite a riot’. CSA MM said nothing to him in reply. He continued on in an aggressive manner for about 30 seconds then headed towards the station exit to leave but then turned around and again continued his tirade. After approx. 20 seconds, he left the station.

As this was an unprovoked assault, there may have been some impairment at play.

I made my way from the CSS office toward the D&C ticket hall when I saw CSA 9856854 standing in front of the entry gate adjacent to WAG24. I approached my colleague and asked what was going on, although it was very apparent to me that this man was very drunk.
CSA 9856854 was calmly saying to the man that he was not fit to travel and suggested he leave the station get some air and a coffee & comeback later to travel.
After a minute or so, I again asked for the BTP via my radio. During our wait the man became very verbally abusive, saying we were racist, homophobic, then he made ageist, and homophobic remarks against me saying that I was a lesbian (which is correct). He asked for a manager, I replied I am the manager. He asked for the police. I replied that the police had been called and that it was his best option to leave the station now before the police arrive.
The man said, I am so old I should be sitting at home by the fire looking after my grandchildren. He accused my colleague of being racist, homophobic and Gay all in the same sentence, he continued with these rants for the whole duration of our wait for BTP assistance.
All this time we did not respond to his statements, just explained to him that he was not fit to travel.

I made my way from the CSS office toward the D&C ticket hall when I saw CSA 9856854 standing in front of the entry gate adjacent to WAG24. I approached my colleague and asked what was going on, although it was very apparent to me that this man was very drunk.
CSA 9856854 was calmly saying to the man that he was not fit to travel and suggested he leave the station get some air and a coffee & comeback later to travel.
After a minute or so, I again asked for the BTP via my radio. During our wait the man became very verbally abusive, saying we were racist, homophobic, then he made ageist, and homophobic remarks against me saying that I was a lesbian (which is correct). He asked for a manager, I replied I am the manager. He asked for the police. I replied that the police had been called and that it was his best option to leave the station now before the police arrive.
The man said, I am so old I should be sitting at home by the fire looking after my grandchildren. He accused my colleague of being racist, homophobic and Gay all in the same sentence, he continued with these rants for the whole duration of our wait for BTP assistance.
All this time we did not respond to his statements, just explained to him that he was not fit to travel.

A male then interrupted the conversation, asking CSS CM to let them out because he was carrying a sleeping child and holding 2 small paper bags.  CSS CM advised he would need to tap out to avoid a penalty fare and use the wide gate at the exit around the other side.  The male told the CSS CM he couldn’t reach his oystercard, hence why he was asking CSS CM to let him out, and gave CSS CM permission to reach into his pocket and take his oystercard out for him.  CSS CM told him, they couldn’t do that and suggested that he ask the other child who was with him on foot to take it out for him, or he could rest the bags on the seat in the photo-me booth whilst he reached for his oystercard.


CSS CM then advised the male that they needed to finish speaking to LAS because they were already speaking to them before he arrived.  The male then began shouting loudly at CSS CM, saying they weren’t being helpful and wanted their name and number to report them, this isn’t customer service.  When CSS CM finished speaking to LAS, they then turned to assist the male by opening WAG21, so they could leave, but the male continued shouting at CSS CM, stating that they were refusing to help them, and they don’t want the gate open, what they want is the CSS name and number.

CSS DT was on Central Line platforms carrying out high visibility during peak to assist customers/public
Approx 16:45 hours - CSS DT sees male with full sized bicycle which was non-foldable.  CSS DT informed the male that he was unable to bring his bicycle at the current time as non-foldable bicycles are not permitted between the times of 16:00 and 19:00 hours. Male then told CSS DT to FUCK OFF and then called CSS DT a FUCKING JEW. CSS DT informed the male that the train will not move, male then responded I will go on the fucking track, male then mounted his bicycle and proceed to ride down the platform, male made more comments when riding his bicycle, but this was inaudible to CSS DT. 

16:46 hours – CSS DT used primary station radio on the call function to call Central Line controller on non-urgent number, but as soon as CSS DT got a answer, CSS DT witnessed the male push open the platform 6 gate (which restricts access to the track area of the central line, at the eastbound part of the platform. This area is restricted area not for the public). CSS DT then cancelled non urgent call to central line controller and by using primary station radio on the call function CSS DT called Central Line controller on the emergency number as male was in the restricted area past the barrier near the track (CSS DT can not confirm if male went on the physical track but male was definitely past the barrier which has multiple signs  

Male then came back onto the public area of platform 5 and 6 and proceed to get on train on platform 5 in the first carriage (in the direction of eastbound travel). 

At approx. 16:50 hours CSS DT noticed male take his phone and started recording or taking pictures of CSS DT with phones flashlight on. Male then started making false allegation whilst having his phone aiming at CSS DT. Male said that CSS DT made a racist comment to him then said CSS DT was causing him to be distressed. CSS DT kept his distance throughout as the male was being aggressive. CSS DT then used his snood to cover his face from the male phone/camera. 

CSS DT then used Elizabeth Line radio to ask Elizabeth Line staff if there was any British Transport Police or enforcement team on the station. The response given was no for either.

Male then crossed from Central Line train 143 which was on platform 5 to train 106 which was on platform 6. 

CSS DT as well as the Train operators on the platform informed the male about the conditions of carriage as well as the railway byelaws. Male responded that he does this journey all the time and that CSS DT was the only person to try and stop him. Male then said I am going to Greenford station. Male then carried on saying that he will go and graffiti and spray paint train tonight. When the male saw one of the female train operators, the male said sister, this male (pointing at CSS DT	) was racist to me when I came here yesterday because he saw me with a Gaza flag. (CSS DT recalls the male and recalls no Gaza or Palestine flag on him so this was another false comment)
 
Male then carried on making further comments but were either inaudible or CSS DT cannot recall due to CSS DT speaking to Train Operators on platform or Central Line control room.

At approx. 17:05 hours male got off the train 105 platform 6 and mounted onto his bike, male made some comments which were inaudible to CSS DT. Male then cycled down the platform past the trains. CSS DT lost sight of the male. CSS DT used station primary radio on the call function to call Central Line Control Room on the urgent number to inform them that male has is no longer on Central Line platforms or trains, so train can proceed. 
CSS DT then used Elizabeth Line radio to ask the gateline staff if the male had left the station.

As per the female customer, the man did not apologise or stop to check on her. She was very infuriated and almost in tears when she was narrating the incident to station staff.

As we she was narrating the incident to myself the customer walked back into the station and the woman confronted him. I attempted to negotiate with the man to apologise to the woman. 

He went straight into a rant with swear language, who the fxxk am I? what the fxxk can I do to him. He kept verbally swearing at both myself and lady customer mainly telling both of us to Fxxk off!!!. He also said he doesn’t care and I can report him to the police for all he cares. No one can touch him.

This infuriated the female customer some more so she started shouting in the ticket hall. The man walked away and said to me he doesn’t give a fxxk and I can follow him to Harold wood for all he cares. 

I could smell alcohol on the man besides he was staggering indicating to me, he was intoxicated. 

I implored to the  lady to report the matter to the police but she said a similar incident happened to her but the police did nothing and that they do not care.

All the males had double gated via the exit WAG and went into Sainsburys supermarket next door to the station.

A few mins thereafter, shopping centre security staff and Sainsburys security staff had escorted the group of males from Sainsburys and the boys were asked to leave.
CSA JO heard the males jeering and being verbal abusive to the shopping centre security.

A little while later, approx 10 mins later, a customer came into the station and stated that a lady was being attacked in the shopping centre. According to CSA1, the lady was very scared and did not want to hang around. The customer asked CSA to 'please help as the lady is being attacked'. CSA1 stated he could hear a woman screaming in the shopping centre from the ticket hall area. CSA looked to see who was screaming and noticed the same group of males who had double gated earlier  were whooping and laughing in the shopping centre. 

2 of the males walked past CSA1 and headed into the station, carrying what appeared to be small boxes of doughnuts. They entered the station and doube gated via the entry WAG. The security guard from the shopping centre came into the ticket hall and followed in the direction of the males. As the security guard turned around, CSA1 stated that he felt something hit him on the side of his head and passed by. CSA stated he was shook up but it did not hurt him. 
CSA questioned the males that threw the box of doughnuts. one of the males said 'boss, boss, we didnt mean to hit you'.

the security guard from the shopping centre wanted to be let in to the paid side of the station and CSA had let him in. The security guard then decided to come back out. 
Again, one of the males who had double gated stated, ' we didnt mean to hit you'.

After a few mins, a few more males (fitting the same description above) who the CSA has recognised in the past with the other males, had also double gated through the way in WAG. 

Security had called Met Police but they said they were too busy to come.
CSA did mention via radio to the CSM to call BTP but was unable to get through, and the assailants had already boarded the train. 
CSM asked CSA if they wish to report the incident to BTP and they declined. CSA stated he did not wanted to call the police as the assailants didnt say anything personal to him and recognised that it was an accident. CSA also stated that he was not hurt.

A colleague approached me by saying that a customer standing on the concourse level had broken the main entrance door by kicking and pushing. The colleague explained that it was 5:10 and about to open the door, when this customer began to shout to open the door and kick it because on the customer opinion he was opening late and it was raining outside.The first train on platform 1 would have arrived at 5:21 and the platform 3 5:34. The colleague explained that the opening time door is 6 minutes prior first train. But the customer kept insisting that he opened the doors late. On my arrival 5:15 both door were opened. 1 door fully operational working, and 1 door (next WHSmith) stuck in a open position, with the header lifter and the door now rubbing on the floor. The customer denied he broke the door, and said that he only pushed it, but didn’t broke it. But colleague informed me since the customer pushing and kicking the door is not working anymore. The colleague informed BTP ( ref n 105/18 November 2023) were they arrived at 5:55 to take statements. At that point the customer had travel with the 9y22 5:34 departure platform 3. The customer said he would happily talk to the police as in his eyes he was right. Even me explaining that nothing would justify the action. But he had to travel to work, so he left details to be contacted:[Personal Details Redacted].The colleague also informed that he was wearing body worn camera (433764) where he was able to record customer, whilst customer was verbally abusing him.
