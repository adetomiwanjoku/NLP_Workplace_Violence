Overheard colleague telling racist passenger that he headbutted him!
Argued for some time than later opened my bus door & forced himself onto my bus when I still had many minutes left to depart. I didn’t want to get involved in a confrontation also. So didn’t try forcing him off the bus! He kept on racially swearing at me calling me a “PAKI”, “GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY ETC!”
I told him to stop his racist chants & ignored & drove off in service on my departure time. He got off after 2 bus stops. He will have been captured on my bus CCTV. Kelly Jordan advised I fill this occurrence report as I had to leave my bus unattended at changeover point because the driver who was scheduled to take over from me apparently was the colleague who earlier got racially & I’m guessing physically assaulted also by this racist drunk passenger who forced himself on my bus.

He said he can’t but did after 30 secs before sticking his middle finger out the window and I leave to proceed to the bus stand. right after parking I notice the same van had done a full circle to come back and is reserving down Wickersley bridge. I continue to fill out my paperwork and he reserved directly infront of the bus in an attempt to intimidate me. So I laugh and get out the cab and open the bus door while 2 passengers inside the vehicle just sit and watch. The drive is the one who gets out and aggressively walks around the van and comes towards me where the first thing I asked him was why did you come back here, to intimidate me which he replied yea to so I said okay lovely so what you going to do? He was all talk and just kept yapping away we both threw insults and then he walks away to turn around and bump into me with his chest and walk past. I just stand up to him and say you’re not scaring me or doing anything and we continue to go back and forth until he finally gets back in his vehicle and is about to drive off before he rolls down his window and says “I hope you get cancer” so I replied I hope your mum dies soon x.

Rough sleeper on upper deck
I went upstairs to wake him up
He was refusing to get up after some words where exchanged he eventually stood up and this point he was angry and verbally threatening and racially abusive
I stepped out of his way so he can go downstairs to receive more racial abuse all the way down to the front door
Although I had left the back door open he went to the front door threatening to damage the bus if I didn't open the door
He then opened the door himself via the emergency button by the door and walked off
As he stepped off I could here him coughing up in preparation to spit so I shut the door immediately behind him as I know these buses door close immediately but he stil managed to spit through the closing doors onto the cab shield and door narrowly missing me.
Got back in the cab shutting back doors whilst doing code red noticed he was trying to go into the bus station was the last I saw of him
Put through a code red they responded promptly and advised me to follow procedure with the spit kit process and call my ibus for further instructions
Called ibus immediately and began the spit kit procedure
As I was finishing the procedure I noticed there was no response from ibus and no welbeing check call for code red/blue calls so I called them again aswell as called them on my phone but as it was after midnight there was no answer or forwarding process after contacting both depots Walthamstow and Ash Grove for guidance I had to call code red again and ask nmcc to contact my ibus and get them to call me on the radio called i received a call on the radio within 5 minutes of that code red.
To this point it was half way through my break time and I was more annoyed at the fact that it took most of my break for ibus to get back to me than the incident that occurred at that point i I lost faith in followong the protocols, unsafe and annoyed that i threw away the spit kit and as it was the 10th hour of a 12 hour shift and i only had 1 trip left on the 2 routes that i was doing for the first time so my mindset then was to put my focus on getting it done and getting home to sleep it off and not recollect the incident which is what i did and why i never told the supervisor or made a report at or nearer the time of the incident",Assault,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,45260.44722,1

I then started hearing insults coming from upstairs towards the girl outside, it was when I realised that the group had stolen her shoes. I went upstairs to ask them to give the shoes back, they refuse and some of them got a bit upset so I ask them to leave the bus and proceed to get back to the cabin. Once I got downstairs one of them push me and when I look back a girl from the stairs snatched my glasses and throw them off the back door. The two guys downstairs started then to push me towards the front of the bus causing me to push the cab door getting it closed, I then got trapped as the front door was closed and they were throwing punches on me, somehow I managed to get off the bus and keep them as far as possible, some passengers got involved trying to separate them from me quite successfully. I then managed to get into the cab and did code red. Police came when they were already gone, ambulance was call but due to the waiting time they gave me I decided to go by myself to the hospital.
