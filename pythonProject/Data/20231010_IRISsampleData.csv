Today I was on duty 319 on the EL1. I was on my last trip, I had just served the Longbridge Road bus stop towards ilford station. I was sat for a while at temporary lights, when randomly an aggresive person came punching my door. I was really shocked and frightened. He then came in front of my bus demanding me to step outside, at this point I was so confused and scared. He continued swearing at me and then came to my driver side window and spat at my face. This occured at 18.48pm on bus LT909.

It deeply saddened me to experience an act of such disrespect and aggression when someone spat on me.

The behaviour was offensive and also degrading, leaving me feeling violated and humiliated as the rest of the passengers watched on. It is disheartening to think that someone would stoop so low as to treat another person with such contempt and disregard for their basic dignity.

Since then the event is repeatedly playing in my head over and over again. At first instance I thought if I just finish my route and go home I might get over what had happened. I called code red instantly and moved off from the location as I did not feel safe to remain there any longer.

Some time has passed and I still don’t understand why this had to happen to me, the situation is traumatic and I feel violated.

I start Travelling from warren street around 18:30 ( journey end around 19:15 at north circular road) toward north circular road / north finchley.Bus driver acts very strange and drive very bad. He doesnt care about passangers life and make a danger for them and people on the road.Basicaly he drive very aggressive, speed/accelerate up like a crazy in short distances and then brakes the same in last moment . He doesnt wait for people who walking down from upstairs to let them go out from bus. Just drive to next bus stop ignoring passengers who tried tell him to open the door or wait for people from up stars. On one of the bus stops he doesnt wait for little kid who walking down stars with father and accelerate like a crazy and then breaks in a second so a little child fall down from the stair and hit with head on the stairs. It was madness. All way looks like this with this driver. Just before my stop he accelerate again and even when he saw a red light he start breaking very late , to even stops after white line on red light. In the middle of the journey he decide to stop on a bus stop and start talking by his phone.It was worst journey ever , very scary and dangerous because of the way how the bus driver drive. I dont knolkw if some one check their ability to drive but i was scared all the way. Im diabetic and stress doesnt help me and its affect my sugar. In one moment my sugar was very high and i start be sleepy. I was afraid to take correct amount of insulin as i was not sure if he doesnt crash the bus in the middle of the road and then i will be not able to rise it after injection.People like this man shouldnt drive a bus when they are responsible for other people life safety and safety on the road >

Customer claims: <I would like to complain about the very poor regulation of passenger behaviour on the buses generally with regard to drivers not enforcing safety and access concerns. I get the 83 bus every day and almost every single day there are people standing on the stairs and in the exit doorway, often with large backpacks. Also passengers often get on via the exit door, not tapping in and not allowing passengers off first. The drivers do nothing. Today I was threatened with being stabbed by a schoolchild because as I was trying to get off he pushed into me, not allowing me off first. I have reported this to the police but would like to ensure that the CCTV footage is available from this bus. It would have been at the Hendon central station bus stop (A) at around 8.38 AM. Generally drivers do not enforce any form of safety measures to ensure passengers are standing in the correct areas. Why are they not instructed to stop the journey until people comply If Passengers fail to comply, call the Police. There is no regulation of bad behaviour whatsoever. I often see drivers allow passengers on without tickets who are claiming they are only going one stop also, should I report the drivers for this>

Customer's statement: <I was driving my vehicle M5XHK (Range Rover) behind the bus, the bus was on the bus stop stationary with the left indicator flashing.
I approached the bus & started my manoeuvre to pass by.
As I was 3 ¼ of the way pass the bus, the bus pulled away from the bus stop & I had to quickly complete my manoeuvre as there was a traffic island in the middle of the road.
I pulled over & stepped out of my car & approached the bus driver. Even before I had opened my door to step out, the bus driver was blowing the horn & flashing the headlights.
I can hear the driver as I approached the side driver window shouting ‘move out the way!, move out the way!’.
My aim was to explain to the driver that there was no need to pull away & accelerate as I was still completing my manoeuvre.
I was calm & remained calm thru out even though there was a female passenger shouting & abusing me thru the driver’s compartment.
I was standing on the corner of the bus next to the driver’s window.
The driver then released the hand brake & suddenly drove the bus towards me & shunted me onto the middle of the road onto oncoming traffic from the opposite lane.
The corner of the bus hit my chest (to the right) & my right shoulder.
I then raised my voice as I thought he was going to do it again.
I then told the driver that I will be taking a picture of him so that I can make a compliant about the aggression.
The driver then shouted, ‘you have no right to take my picture!’.
The driver then exited the driving compartment & came off the bus.
As the driver was exiting the compartment the bus further moved ahead with no control by the driver.
The driver came out & again shouted, ‘you have no right to take my picture!’.
At that point, the female passenger also came off the bus & started to shout abuse to me.
I then got into my vehicle & drove away to calm down the situation.
I was travelling with my special needs daughter & she was very upset.>

Bus driver statement: <I finished serving the Bus Stop and indicated right to drive off. The stop is on the road and first a vehicle overtake and then a second and he was the third.
