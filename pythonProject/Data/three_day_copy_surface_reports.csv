There was a group of around five older teens that was trying to break up the fight after the fight was eventually broken up and I got the main aggressor of the bus and secured the bus with the teenager that had been attacked. the older teens told me that the boy that had been attacked is in a lower year to them.

He came on the bus feeling agitated.  He showed me Safer’s ticket and tore it. He asked if I wanted a piece of it. I told him to stick it to the doorframe because my instinct told me not to open the cab door. 

That was when he kicked off. He already got his phone out recording everything from the beginning. 

He called me cunt while recording. He said some drivers refused to let him on the bus with his children in the past weeks/months because he refused to give part of the safest ticket. He was aggressive in his talking and angry. 

I told him he couldn't travel because he had called me cunt. He keeps doing the video and calling me all sorts of names. He said the video would go Viral, he would take it to the mayor of London, etc. He said many things. He refused to get off the bus.

He later called his wife who came with a PITBULL  “ DOG” I don't know what they are trying to do. I called the Code red button/Controller to Update them on the situation. He later came down from the bus and I drove away.

NB .... HE CALLED ME CUNT AND REFUSED TO GET OFF THE BUS WHEN I REFUSED TO WITH HIM ON THE BUS.",Assault,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,24/11/2023 08:16,1

Route 274 
Vehicle VWH2339 
Run No: 334
Trip No:75

1) At around 12.41hrs I approached the junction Caledonian Rd/Market Rd/ McKenzie Rd.
2) A small truck was in front and  a car fit sure in front of it to turn right into McKenzie Rd awaiting to have clearance from oncoming traffic.
3) The first vehicle took the right  the truck was going as well but stopped despite no oncoming traffic and had the hazards lights on. 

4) Incident of Verbal Abuse

A female pedestrian was standing at the safety pedestrian island awaiting for the red man to turn into green. 
I asked: ""Sorry Ma'm, is anything in front of the truck stopping it to move?""
The pedestrian replied:
""You f****** idiot, all bus drivers are f****** idiots, don't you see it has got the hazards lights on?
With disbelief I said: ""I only asked you a question as I can't see from here, you don't have to swear at me!!!""

She started crossing still moving her lips but couldn't hear what she was saying when passing in front of the windscreen. She mounted the pavement and was taking pictures of the bus from 7.30 o'clock. I was opening the door (which was defective since I took over the bus from ISLN GRs as the latch would give in even with the lock on) to ascertain what was going on with the truck when the pedestrian returned by the front door with the intention of taking a picture of me at which I showed my Badge Number 751999. She told me ""I'm going to report you to TfL"" at which I said: ""I had only asked you a question. You are mad. Write whatever you want!!! . 

5) I had to advise the passengers for I had to ascertain the gravity of the road blockage and to remain seated with a please and I also requested if anyone would be willing to leave a phone number (no address and no name) to witness the total unprovoked behaviour of the pedestrian at which I noticed some were nodding negatively. 
I said: ""thank you for your support"" and I went by the truck nearside.
A female on passenger seat. A male on driver seat  was handling some wires coming from under the steering wheel. 
I said: ""Has it broken down mate?"". The driver told me he was having problem with the immobiliser. 
I returned to the cab and I did Code Red. It was 12.45hrs. NMCC got back to me and as I was dealing with it the truck moved off. I quickly cleared the Code Red and moved on. 

This was the incident itself. 

At the stop York Way Estate I called iBus on landline and told about the door latch problem and what had happened about the Verbal Assault. One SC told me it was not assault. (I today learnt from another SC that it's called Verbal Abuse)

Engineers asked me if I could use the top latch (the door can still be pulled and/or ripped off open from someone strong) and would meet me later on in regard to the faulty latch at which I agreed (the bus behind was 12' so I didn't feel to cause further disruption to the service) 

I ""swallowed"" the unprovoked Verbal Abuse for the ""bigger picture"" and carried on on duty almost reduced to tears due to the incredible lovely people I had the luck to come across with. 

I'm not sure if the lost mileage (I had a ""projection"" LCGT to BKST the following trip - No 2032) is due to this incident as there were severe congestion delays at the 4 ways temporary lights at 
Oxford St/Portman St and as the
SC didn't specify the reason, it usually goes down to Tr (Traffic). 

Please do not hesitate to call me in should the threatened report be made to TfL by the female pedestrian individual. 
 
Please note: 
At Pratt Street bus stop a female passenger asked me if I could let her off despite I had already served the stop at which I consented despite she was one of the unsupportive passengers to witness the cause of this very Occurrence Report which proves I do not carry grudges or revenge regardless.
