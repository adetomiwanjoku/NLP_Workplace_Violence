I radioed my colleagues in the ticket hall.  I informed LUCC that the police were needed to attend. My colleagues informed me that there was an aggressive customer.  I informed them to stay in place of safety and withdraw to the mess room complex as the person was close to them in the ticket hall.   I got LUCC ref 105.   I made my way to the lower concourse and started writing the description of the male who was coming down the escalator.  He came up to my face and moved away.  He shouted “fuck Israel” a few times and he hit my right hand hard as I was writing.  I felt some pain in my right hand.  Items dropped from my hand.  I picked up what had dropped.    He folded his hand near his body as if he wanted to bring out a weapon.  At this point I decided to take evasive action and ran.  He chased me but was unable to catch up with me.  Train Operator MS was on platform 1 as I arrived the platform after going through cross passage from platform 2 on my way to a place of safety.   He asked me what happened.  I informed him that he had been aggressive to staff.  Train Operator MS informed me that the male  had got on the train that was on platform 1. CSA SM, CSA SH and CSA MM came to the platform as some customers who saw what he had done had informed them upstairs that I was being attacked.    I informed the service controller that the male was on the train and she spoke to the driver.  The train did not move whilst awaiting BTP when the male was still on it.  It was train 234 lead car 11071.  Trains Manager CD came to assist.  We closed all the doors to the train ensuring that no customer was on the train.  I updated the Service Manager who had called me shortly after the incident started.  I called LUCC at 1947 for an update.  I was informed that the Met and BTP were on the way to attend. After some time, I received a radio call from one of my colleagues informing me that the male was on the overground platform 2.  He had got off the train through the space between carriages, I was later informed.  I made my way towards the overground  and also communicated with the overground supervisor informing him to tell his colleagues to keep their distance from the male.  I observed him walk to the edge of the platform as if he wanted to get on the overground track.  Met call sign N8(L) arrived at approximately 1956, followed shortly after by BTP call sign B33, Met call sign NE20(L) and PC 1733NA.  The male was arrested on the overground premises.  He was taken off the overground station at approximately 2010.  I did duty of care with CSA MM.  He said he was tense. Two tagging request forms were filled as some video footage of the incident was taken by staff.  The four station staff on duty had been issued body worn cameras.

A black male, dressed in all black came into the station with an un-foldable bike via Exit 7. 

After being told by CSA1 that this part of the network, unfolded bikes weren’t allowed as he approached entry gate 21, he was told the same again by CSM1. CSM1 even pointed to the poster depicting where on the network unfolded bikes could be taken. The male took umbridge to this as he was in a rush and began swearing and abusing CSM1 that we’d needlessly allowed him to top up his oyster card before telling him he couldn’t travel. We hadn’t had any interaction with the male prior to him approaching an entry gate as he had topped up his oyster card by himself. A person topping up their oyster card, even with an un-foldable bike, isn’t out of the ordinary as some people merely pass through the station. 

As the male became abusive, CSM1 switched on BWC 239366 and decided to walk away as the male wasn’t listening to reason. As CSM1 was walking away with the male having now threatened to assault CSM1, he barged his bike into the back of CSM1’s right leg and the proceeded to swear more and finally leave via Exit 2. 

BTP were informed with a reference of 702 of 20/10/2023 given. The male topped up his oyster card at 22:21 on MFM 30. BWC footage will be tagged.

Summary of Events: Two ic1 males were causing anti social behaviour in the station. They were shouting and using a lot of profanity. I was helping a customer when the incident happened, I noticed one of the males was demanding for the station security staff to open the gate. The security staff didn’t say anything so the assailant pushed through the gate and punched him. I went to him as soon as I saw this and asked if he was alright. The assailants started on me beginning to shove and push me. I asked them to leave calmly but they were still being aggressive. They threatened to beat me up and were still hanging around the security staff to try and attack him further. I came in between and tried my level best to defuse the situation. I tried to get the staff to run to the mess room but they were blocking the way. Eventually they started leaving still focused with me and my colleague and we headed for the mess room.

Summary of Events: Whilst conducting a ticket check on Heathrow T5 service (9T48) that departed Ealing Broadway at 09:12, I approached a seated male. When I asked to see his ticket, he produced a 11-15 child zip oyster. The photograph on the card was partly scratched out but I could just about make out that it was a young female. I asked the male who the card belongs to and he said it’s his card. When I asked to see his ID to confirm he said he couldn’t find it. Male said he was 17 but appeared to be much older. While still holding the zip card in my hand after inspecting it with my RID device, I  proceeded to ask for his name and address details. He then became aggressive and asked me to give the zip card back. I informed him that because I suspect the zip card is transferred and doesn’t belong to him I won’t be able to give it back to him. At this point male suddenly stood up and lunged towards me  and got into my personal space, saying ‘You’re not taking anything from me!’. Male got right in my face, at which point I asked the male to calm down and not to come into my personal space. He then grabbed my left hand and twisted it in an attempt to take the zip card. Because of the force he was applying the zip card broke into pieces whilst still in my hand. As he suddenly snatched the pieces of the broken card from my hand the sharp edges grazed the inside of my hand. TSO Emilia stepped in and asked him to move away but he kept saying ‘Shut the fuck up’. Eventually the male sat back down. I asked him where he was travelling to which he replied ‘Shut the fuck up. You don’t need to know’. TSO Emilia called BTP and was on the phone to them as the train was departing Southall. On arrival to Hayes and Harlington, male got off the train. Myself and Emilia also alighted but stayed back and did not interact with the male. When we got to the gateline male tailgated out behind a female he was travelling with to exit the station. He then turned back and showed his middle finger to us and left the station.

Owing to an on-going incident on the District Line at the time, T023 was given a last-minute instruction to reverse their train W/B to Eastbound (E/B) at EMB Platform 1.

Owing to this last second diversion the Operator was unable to give a pre-warning to passengers who were expecting the train to be going through to Richmond (RIC).

This meant that when the Operator went to change ends at EMB they were met with some passenger frustrations as to why they had not been informed earlier. 

The Operator advised that one male passenger in particular verbally assaulted them with use of profanity whilst changing ends inside the train and was quite intimidating. 

The Operator stated that they tried to help them but owing to their behaviour had to tell them to go away and left them to change ends. 

This passenger encounter left the Operator feeling quite shaky but did depart their train in passenger service to Upminster (UPM). 

Duty Reliability Manager (DRM) 6698596 met T023 at Tower Hill (TOH) E/B to check on the welfare of the Operator.   

The Operator advised that they were still feeling quite shaky following the incident, had left them feeling a little sick and also had a headache. 

DRM 6698596 asked the Operator if they were fit to continue and would ride with them to UPM just to make sure they were ok, the Operator kindly accepted this and stated that they were ok to continue. 

Owing to service disruption T023 was short tripped from its UPM destination to Barking (BAR) Sidings and was stabled on 22 Road.

The Operator and DRM 6698596 made their way to UPM. The Operator and DRM 6698596 had a good chat about the incident and the Operator stated that they were now feeling much better. 

Once at UPM the Operator thanked DRM 6698596 for their assistance and went onto Meal Break with the view to continuing their duty. 

Following the Operators Meal Relief that did not feel fit enough to continue their duty and booked off. 

T004 cancelled in consequence 16:34 UPM W/B until its Stable As Booked (SAB) time 20:09 UPM Depot. 

DRM 6698596 advised that as the Operator was subject to a verbal assault they would raise a report via the EIRF system. 

Saloon Car CCTV download requested on the 05.01.2024.

CSS then backed off as the T/OP had jumped back on the train and began to detrain from the inside of the carriages. 
00:53 – Customer starts to pursue the ABM cleaner in which the CSS tells the cleaner to leave. Customer turns back to CSS and pushes CSS towards the train.

Summary of Events: As I was on a Gateline at Custom House an IC3 female approached me for help telling me that she’s coming from Cyprus on DLR and she already topped up her Oyster card £10 and now there is no money on her Oyster card. I advised her to come with me at the TVM machine that we can check if I can help her. When we went at the machine I’m asking her did you tap out she said to me yes I did. As I’m checking the history on her Oyster card it shows that she didn’t tap out on DLR at Custom House.I’m telling her I’m sorry but here it shows that you didn’t tap out but she’s insisting that she did then I’m just pointing at the DLR reader and then she says not that one, and then I told her that’s why you tapped at the wrong reader that’s why it did charge you a maximum fare. After that she started being more aggressive to me she says ok now I want you to do a refund. I told her I can’t do a refund the only advice I can give you is call TFL and then they might do a refund for you. After that she goes to me what’s your name, taking a picture of me. I told her you can take my name but don’t take a picture. And then she says to me go now I don’t need you. After that I did leave went at the Gateline as I’m dealing with another customer she’s passing through the gate and looking at me and calling me an idiot. This is becoming most common at Custom House, there’s no signage on the DLR side, raised with management a Year ago without any solution.

I advised him that we had just been notified that they had been suspended but didn’t have any further information, but the service was likely to remain poor due to late notice. 

The male made his way downstairs and came back up to say he wanted to make a complaint about CSA. I advised him the best way to do so would be online, but I would log the conversation. The males attitude changed immediately, and he started questioning ‘but you’re a supervisor’ I explained that I was, but complaints go higher than myself.

CSA made his way up from his security check during this conversation. The male started goading and raising his voice at CSA. CSS advised them to both stop engaging with each other and CSA went to continue the security check. CSS said to the male that if the aggressive behaviour continued then I would be stopping the conversation as I cannot condone the way he was speaking to our staff. 

CSA advised me after the incident that the male had also said to him If he was in the street he would give him a slap and also called him racist to which the CSA replied that was a very serious offence.

The male then started raising his voice at me throwing questions but then continuously interrupting my responses. An older female customer interrupted to ask a question and the male started shouting at her calling her a ‘fucking rude bitch’ and accusing ‘females of ganging up on him’. At one point he asked her why she was getting involved to which the female responded, ‘because you’re shouting at her’ (CSS). She eventually left the station but before doing so she approached the CSA to advise him to call the police as she was concerned about my safety. He also accused me multiple times of gaslighting him. 

This continued back and forth until I told the male I was no longer having this conversation and I bought both the CSA and the station cleaner into the office and plunged the gates for our safety. The male continued shouting and ranting at the window to which no one engaged. He eventually left via train P1.

CSS tried to get hold of BTP throughout the incident but received no answer. BTP contact made the following day ref. 76-080124

Full memo of incident obtained from CSA. CSMs advised and duty of care given to CSA who said he was okay to continue. CSS left very shaken and upset.

When the CSM arrived in the ticket hall he heard a female customer shouting towards the CSA who was leaving the Metropolitan ticket hall and making his way to the Bakerloo ticket hall. The CSM attended to the customer who said she wanted a train to Amersham. The CSM said that she should take the first train to Harrow on the Hill and change there. The customer said why to which the CSM replied there were delays because there was going to be a strike but it was called off at short notice. 
The customer then said why are you striking to which the CSM replied he was not striking but the strike is with regards to terms and conditions. The customer repeated the question to which the CSM replied saying terms and conditions and pay. The customer then said, you are always going on strike if you don’t like it here you should go to another country. The CSM replied what did you just say to which the customer replied to you should leave here and go to another country.
The CSM then said to the customer that is a racist remark how dare you. 
At this point a few other customers came over and told me to report her to the Police. The CSM declined and told the customer that he would not assist her further and the CSM left the ticket hall and went to the Station Control room as the customer took out her phone and started to film the CSM.

CSA 9849465 account of the incident is documented below.
At 08:33hrs a customer verbally assaulted me calling me ‘cunt’ and a dick’ I was standing in front of the entry gate 40 because it was not closing after a person scans through with their oyster card and customers would assume that their touches were registered. Additionally, I was directing customers to use the side manual gate. A staff member showed me their pass and I allowed the individual to scan through gate 40 with their staff oyster card. The offender then verbally abused me. This verbal assault was un-provoked and unexpected. The customer who abused me used his bank card and I tapped my card three times on UTS gate 40, in order to identify his details if possible. Description of the offender is a Caucasian, blueish grey eyes, silver blonde hair and red patches on his face from what I assume is a skin infection and he was wearing optical lenses.

12:35 Duty of care provided to CSA 9849465 by CSM BRX 02 and he has stated that assistance from Trauma Support is not required. This was offered several times during a conversation about the incident. 
12:40 Finally contact made with the BTP on 109 and spoke to British Transport police call handler with badge number: 2994. He referred CSA 9849465 to their web site, in order to log details of the incident and generate a crime reference number as it was not a live incident and a verbal assault.

A member of the public  reported to myself and Area Manager Robert Jones that a young girl of about 15 years old was being bullied in the station. AM Jones went quickly to the location by the sweetshop tenant where a young black female in school uniform was kneeling on the floor surrounded by about 7 other children of ages estimated 14/15/16, approx. 5 females and one male. All dressed in black school uniform, possibly from Roxeth Secondary School. 

AM Jones asked what was going on and asked the kneeling female to stand up and for the persons to leave the station if they were not travelling. The children asked why they had to leave and the girl kneeling said she liked kneeling on the floor. AM Jones stated he was not comfortable with this situation and informed the group that he was going to call the Police. At this the children all ran out of the station. 

Ms Ajeo thanked us for intervening and stated she felt the female kneeling was vulnerable and was being bullied. AM Jones looked outside to see if there was any sign of the children but they had apparently left the area. 

This incident will have been captured on camera by the station CCTV.

CSA 6701768 came to the CSM's office where a welfare check was carried out. He stated that he was OK. I asked if BTP was called and he stated that no and that he did not want to contact them. 
CSA explained that, as he was detraining, the customer was sleeping and he did what they would normally do to wake them up but he wouldn't.  He first of all removed his bag to the platform and tried to wake him up again at this point he was approaching him aggressively. The customer tried to grab the CSA  but went forward as if he was to head bud him hurting himself and was bleeding from the mouth. CSA X stated that, the train Op came to assist. The C2C security team came and moved the customer from the station.
The customer spoke in a foreign accent. 

Whilst in the CSM's office, C2C security brought in a Met Police officer (1201T) PC Smith. He spoke to the CSA and acknowledge that the customer is in their custody. CSA X narrated the scenario to the PC who later went back to their van to speak with the customer.

He acknowledge that the customer was highly intoxicated and did not even recognise the fact that he was in London as he should have been in Amsterdam.
PC stated that the customer stated that staff were good to him but that a member of the public got involved. PC stated that the customer does not want to press charges and he has been discharged. No case reference was generated as he was a foreigner travailing back to Amsterdam.
I contacted the Train Managers' office and updated them. However, the Met Police did not speak to the train Op though I advised him that she was with her Manager.

CSS(1) approached the male to see if the male was okay or required assistance.  
CSS(1) then recognized that the male was very intoxicated, with slurred speech and unsteady on his feet. CSS(1) then used Elizabeth Line radio to request their staff attendance or land sheriff (who were on site earlier prior to incident). This was to give CSS(1) more staff assistance with the male.
Male then told CSS(1) to fuck off and then proceed at a fast walk approach towards CSS(1), forcing CSS(1) take multiple steps back before CSS(1) used his left hand in a open palm to push the male back in his chest area to create a safe distance, as male was in very close distance to CSS(1).

CSS(1) during the interaction with the male, CSS(1) used his radio on the call function to call 999 for British Transport Police for assistance but these calls continued to ring with no answer.
Whilst the male was walking towards the platform 4 (Elizabeth line Eastbound) CSS(1) followed the male to ensure that he did not harm himself or others as CSS(1) was not sure of males intentions.

Male then started to board Elizabeth Line train (9U31 Abbey Wood service) CSS(1) tried to ask the male to stay on the platform and not to board the train as the male was intoxicated and danger to himself or others due to his behaviour and being unsteady on his feet. 
When the train departed with the male on it CSS(1) witnessed the male struggling to keep his balance on the and looked to fall onto the seats which people were seating on.
CSS(1) then used his radio on the call function to call LUCC on 1800 to request police support as 999 calls was not being answered and CSS(1)  wanted to report incident to the police and see if the Elizabeth Line train could be met at Paddington Station which was the next stop as it was a fast train (meaning it would not stop at Acton Main Line station).
During the time CSS(1) was interacting with the male, the male used his hand to strike CSS(1) in the face mostly directed in the chin area. 


MTR/Elizabeth Line staff informed their control room and CSS(1) managed to contact British Transport Police and informed them of what had occurred and information on the train.

Assault by Drunk and Aggressive male while trying to detrain. 

Both drivers remain off Sick as of 13th Jan. 

CCTV reviewed and DRM stated nothing of any relevance or incident related on any of the Cameras and therefore unable to attach story board. However CSM had BWV camera footage which is pending download. 

Below is the station EIRF.
At 0047 hours, an altercation unfolded on platform CSM, prompting the vigilant driver to alert CSM via PHP about the disturbance. The driver urgently requested police intervention, leading CSM to dial 999 under reference  020. Subsequently, CSM and 2 CSA's responded to the call. Upon arriving at the platform, they observed a heated dispute involving an Asian male and two drivers. The train driver reported the customer as highly aggressive, claiming he had been threatened with a knife. Despite attempts to pacify the situation, the customer persisted in shouting and spitting at the drivers. Eventually, the customer physically assaulted one of the drivers by punching him in the face, causing visible distress. The colleague of the assaulted driver also faced verbal and racial abuse. CSM ensured the drivers received proper duty of care, reporting the incident to the service manager . BTP officers arrived at 0058, arresting the male for further investigation. The line controller opted not to halt trains on the eastbound platform during the altercation due to safety concerns. Following the arrest, train stops resumed at 0105. The incident was documented by body camera 258395 at 0118. As per request from SOO, CSM contacted her for incident details.",,16/01/2024 00:00

Subject: Abusive behaviour from customer

Good afternoon everyone,

A male, came yesterday and asked me to let him out so he can drop his wife and come back quickly, I let him out but he came back after almost an hour at about 12:15. So I told him he needed to make new journey because it was too long. He started being abusive and called me racist. He was right on my face so I stepped back and asked him to step back but he was very aggressive and threatening. CSA Crystal finally let him in to make it go away.

This is to make everyone aware of the incident.

I attended car 1 with a t/op and found a male passenger dressed in black, sitting in the very end seat closest to train op door on the platform side.
Passenger appeared semi-conscious and after a couple of taps with my j door key on the glass panel at the end of the row of seats, I advised it is the end of the line I would like you to leave the train, he responded “yeah yeah10 seconds 10 seconds”. I gave him a mental count of 10 plus a few more and tried again with the Jdoor key tapping and the same statement. 
Passenger continued to wake and nod off and after a few more attempts of the above I moved closer to the passenger and banged my jdoor key on the window closer to him (he was seat 1, I would be seat 3) to attempt to rouse him and said we are asking him to leave the train. 
I asked the train op to call the BTP via the controller because of his refusal to alight and handed the posters to the HAL staff at the gateline. Train op staff number 9693187 advised that the BTP had been called and the Line Controller had a reference number for me. I continued to make similar attempts as before to encourage the passenger to leave the train.
When he was awake, I advised him that I am not asking him to leave the station, purely the train and he can take a seat on the platform area or continue his journey from the other platform. 
Passenger fell back asleep, and as I approached he woke and I put my hand on his shoulder in an effort to get his attention and persisted with my statement to leave the train. He said suck your mum several times and I will fuck you up. He fell back asleep (proceeded to shut his eyes again) I touched the sole of his foot with my toe, keeping my distance, to again attempt to wake him. If you say anything more to me, “I will fuck you up”. 
I asked him to leave again advising he was holding everybody on the station up and he rose from his seat and spat at me deliberately with intent, the spit landing on the back of my left hand, definitely my Hi Vi and potentially my polo shirt. I called him a coward for spitting at me and asked him to leave the train again, which he did. The passenger made a spitting action (but not spitting directly) to my face as he passed in a very aggressive manner.
I shut the train doors via the porter button, informed the t/op, and then followed the passenger to the eastbound platform where he sat on the second last seat towards the tailwall of the platform, I took a photo to Identify him and told him his actions where scummy and proceeded to wait with the HAL DSM at approximately the location of car 5, until train 310 berthed in the eastbound platform.
The passenger boarded car 228 and the second or third seat from the rear cab door, again platform side, and appeared to fall asleep.
I went to the headwall to speak with the Train Operator and rang the Line Controller to update. Line Controller advised that as the passenger was now not a problem, they would be moving the train.
I informed the Line Controller that he had been a massive problem and I was really upset given the circumstances and requested further action be taken. The photo was sent to LUCC to pass on to BTP for identification purposes. 
1147hrs I received a call from BTP to advise that they were on route to Hatton Cross to intercept and at 11:53 received a call to say passenger had been apprehended.
Spit kit swab was taken with the assistance of staff 9805616, Staff 5690223 provided duty of care as did staff 3692755 from Hatton Cross. Hi-Vi and Polo Shirt have been bagged for collection by BTP for potential sample testing, as requested, along with the DNA spit kit.

The spitting was witnessed by T/op Staff 9693187 who was with another t/op although I have no idea who they were, or, if they witnessed anything.

The white male at the time was on the escalator and when he stepped off he said to CSM 7696831 have I committed a crime. CSM 7696831 advised the white male that he had as he was drinking from an open bottle vodka whilst on Tfl premises. The customer then said to me he didn't understand what I was saying. CSM 7696831 said to male customer that the last westbound was in 5 minutes and he should keep it moving. At this point CSM went into the lobby corridor 2/411 and then shut the door behind him,  The male customer kicked in the outside door. When CSM 7696831 had done his checks in the lobby he came out to the customer threatening him and telling him to come outside and he would fuck him up and if he was hard he would come outside and face him. At this point CSM 7696831 turned on his BWC and advised the customer.  The male customer then apologised and CSM 7696831 was then told by a female member of staff who was going home to ignore him. The aggressive intoxicated male customer was telling the CSM 7696831 that he looked ugly and look like he had cancer several times and that he should go doctors and get himself checked out. Also the aggressive intoxicated male customer said to CSM 7696831 that he look like he only had 3 months to live. CSM 7696831 said it's ok. CSM 7696831 tried to keep his distance but the aggressive intoxicated male customer then try to push pass the female member of staff. Another male customer around 50 possibly of eastern European asked what was up and CSM 7696831 advised him that the other male customer who was intoxicated had to much to drink. The male customer who was verbally abusing CSM 7696831 then turned to the other male customer asking what he was looking at and did he want a piece of him. The female member of staff was also trying with CSM 7696831 to calm down the situation.  After about 8 minutes The male customer who had been verbally abusing and threatening CSM 7696831 apologised to him saying he was out of order and that he didn't deserve this and that he was an arsehole. Just before this at around 23:10 CSM 7696831 radioed CSA 9842604 to advise him of the situation and after a few minutes he came to the lower concourse. Both male customers were now angry and threatening to beat each other up. CSM 7696831 stepped in between the both whilst trying to usher away the second male customer who was around 50 years away from the other aggressive intoxicated male customer with the help off CSA 9842604 and the other female member of staff who was off duty. After a few minutes. CSA 9842604 and the female member of staff off duty managed to get the innocent male customer (50) to the other platform awaiting the last westbound train. The aggressive intoxicated male customer was told by CSA 9842604 that other customer had left the station and he may his way to the gate line and pushed through the gate line.  After 5 minutes the aggressive male customer who was 5ft 4inches came back into the station and pushed through the gate and made his way downstairs again looking for the other male customer who had already boarded the last westbound train 351. CSA 9842604 advised CSM 7696831 that the customer was on his way down and CSM 7696831 was still completing his checks and stayed in the P-Way for around 4 minutes. CSM 7696831 then asked if the aggressive male customer was around to which he replied that the aggressive intoxicated male customer had left the station by touching his bank card. The bottle he was drinking was original vodka. The female member of staff boarded an eastbound Cockfosters train at around 23:14. CSM 7696831 did advise CSA 9842604 to wait in the office until he had come back from his checks and whilst CSA 9842604 he witnessed the aggressive intoxicated male hitting the Glap.

The CSS at Kew (listed) called the Service Controller, but was unable to get through quickly and then called the BTP who took a long time gathering information before reacting. When we spoke about the incident later she admitted she had rung 104, not 904, so we discussed the importance of using the emergency number for staff assaults.

When I spoke to the CSM who was assaulted, she assured me repeatedly that she was completely unharmed, was not worried about the incident at any level and had already discussed the matter with her Area Manager. 

The CSM ravelled to Gunnersbury to see if the CCTV depicted the departure of the perpetrator there, but the coverage is poor at Gunnersbury and the CSM could not see him there on the footage.

He witnessed a male person, who appeared to be attempting to abscond from police officers, barge through wide aisle gate number 55 (way OUT) and immediately push over RCI TK, who fell and landed on his left knee. RCI TK was assisted in his stability at this point by RCO SM who was adjacent to him and sustained a scratched hand whilst assisting. The undersigned immediately attended to RCI TK to provide support upon seeing this unfold, and did not witness any further events: 

It is clear that the male concerned then continued his attempts to abscond, at which point RCIs CV and GL state they were injured during the subsequent scuffle as BTP officers effected their arrest of the male. Testimony received from RCI CK is as follows:

""Way out 14:10
Male doubled out and ran from the police, had collided with Tahir sending him backwards causing him to fall to the ground backwards injuring his left knee and cut lip.

Male ran in a different direction colliding with RCI Vallis and RCI Loprieno causing pain in RCI Vallis's right shoulder and jaw, and bruising RCI Loprieno's left shin.

I approached the 1st female who had come though without tapping to ask to she her ticket or pass, she refused to stop and then preceded to ram her pram into my right leg with force.  I felt a sudden shoot of pain go though my leg as the pram hit it just above the ankle.
I said to the female that she had just pushed the buggy into my leg and that she had just walked though without paying.  She then started to shout at me and pulled her pram back towards her and I was unsure if she was going to ram her pram back into me which she did.  The female then went to pulled her pram back again, it was at this point, LU414 (Lawrence) who was now beside me, placed his hand on the pram, the female who was pushing the pram then pushed the pram to one side then kicked out at LU414 on his left upper thigh.

3 females with 2 buggies came through the WAG. 

Front female paid. Other two, with buggy did not attempt to tap / pay.

RCI 302 Graham challenged 2nd woman (1st non paying female who had a buggy) asking her for her pass.

This female proceeded to ram the buggy at his legs with force. I saw RCI 302 hop back his leg when it was struck like it had caused him pain. This looked like a clear and deliberate act / decision she made.

This was so aggressive that I decided to ignore the last female and assist RCI 302.

I have approached this 2nd female and stood to the left hand side of RCI 302. 

At this point I have seen this female who was shouting and swearing clench her jaw and her arms pulling back the pram. I feared that she was winding up to ram the pram at RCI 302 again so I placed my hand on the handle of the buggy. I did not try to move to buggy but used a resistant force to stop the pram being shoved into RCI 302. At this point it felt like she pushed against me with force. If I had not stopped the buggy it would have struck RCI 302 with a lot of force.

She then turned her attention and shouted at me. She immediately turned the buggy and then kicked me with her right leg striking me on the left thigh with a lot of force. I felt a pain go through my leg as she struck me. 

At this point I have let go of the pram and stepped back. The female then pushed the pram around RCI 302 still shouting and swearing and headed towards the far lift / escalator.  

At this stage because of the violence and aggression shown by the female we have watched the group leave the gate line and have used radios to contract control and police.
