Because the customer didn't do it in a serious way, CSA Gibbs understood that. But knows that doesn't make it alright to do.
CSS Radcliffe asked if there was anything else they could do for CSA Gibbs. But they were happy to continue with their shift.
CSA Gibbs does have a lot going on in their personal life and was happy to share it with me. We had a good conversation and they definitely calmed down after that.
CSA Gibbs was given time to take a breather before continuing with work.

I have asked Nana again if he is okay and if he wants the matter to be taken further, perhaps reporting to the Police and Nana does not feel that is necessary.
