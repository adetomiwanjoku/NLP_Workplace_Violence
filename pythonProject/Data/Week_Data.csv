Summary of Events: I was dispatching on platform 8 and a customer came of the service (9C68) during this time I was closely monitoring an individual who was intoxicated to ensure he did not go near the train, the customer who got off the train was asking me a question but I told him politely to wait as I was dispatching. After the train departed I approached the customer and asked how can I help. He kissed his teeth and started to scream abuse at me including racist comments. There was a couple on the platform who came over to help me and the customer then started on them also. The customer took my name and said he will complain about me. The couple involved said they will be reporting the individual and passed me their details as they witnessed everything.

Summary of Events: At 5:15 I entered Abbey Wood station to start my shift 5:19. A colleague approached me by saying that a customer standing on the concourse level had broken the main entrance door by kicking and pushing. The colleague explained that it was 5:10 and about to open the door, when this customer began to shout to open the door and kick it because on the customer opinion he was opening late and it was raining outside.The first train on platform 1 would have arrived at 5:21 and the platform 3 5:34. The colleague explained that the opening time door is 6 minutes prior first train. But the customer kept insisting that he opened the doors late. On my arrival 5:15 both door were opened. 1 door fully operational working, and 1 door (next WHSmith) stuck in a open position, with the header lifter and the door now rubbing on the floor. The customer denied he broke the door, and said that he only pushed it, but didn’t broke it. But colleague informed me since the customer pushing and kicking the door is not working anymore. The colleague informed BTP ( ref n 105/18 November 2023) were they arrived at 5:55 to take statements. At that point the customer had travel with the 9y22 5:34 departure platform 3. The customer said he would happily talk to the police as in his eyes he was right. Even me explaining that nothing would justify the action. But he had to travel to work, so he left details to be contacted:[Personal Details Redacted].The colleague also informed that he was wearing body worn camera (433764) where he was able to record customer, whilst customer was verbally abusing him.

Summary of Events: A train arrived onto platform B which terminated at Paddington, it is my responsibility to sweep the train and make sure it’s clear of passengers and any lost property and security hazards. A passenger was on my train who was intoxicated and asleep, I woke him up and informed him that he has reached the last stop and that he had to change. It then took the passenger about a minute for him to leave the train which he eventually did.Now another train arrived right after which also terminated at PDX, passenger announcements was repeatedly made for customers not to board this train, however the male still boarded the train. As I began to sweep my cars I kindly asked for the passengers to leave the train, the customer began complaining about the train and me removing him from the train, in which I also kindly asked. As I came out the train to close the remaining cars and complete the train sweep, his voice began getting more frustrated towards me in which I then informed him to wait for his train on the platform. Then In front of a number of passengers along the platform he then said “I’ll kill you.”  I then calmly replied “You know you’ve just said you’re going to kill me in front of many customers and witnesses”, the passenger then walked off towards the head end of platform B. Alpha 1 was informed and we were then awaiting for the BTP.

CSS observes from the control room and notices a second female member of staff, also stationed at the gateline at the time, attempting to defuse the situation by positioning herself between the verbally abused staff and the assailant. 
19:51- Two additional CSAs now stand at the gateline, by the paid side of near the eastern glap. CSS instructs gateline staff over the radio to activate their BWV cameras.
19:52 – CSS arrives at the gateline, loudly tells the abusive customer that video and audio footage is about to be recorded and activates his BWVC camera. The assailant is still verbally abusing staff and ,while moving away from the scene, he is heard saying that “he will be back for her ( CSA HA) as he livers around here”. He taps out and leaves the station shortly after the BWV camera is used. 
The number of the BWV camera activated by CSS is 792239. Footage should be available from around 19:50 onwards for the duration of 3 minutes.
19:54 – CSS approaches CSA HA and provides the necessary duty of care, ensuring her well-being and offering to call the BTP. CSA HA declines, stating that she is fine and does not wish to report the incident to the police.
19:58 - CSS retuned to Station Control Room, docks his assigned BWV camera and leaves Battersea Power Station to resume his cross-station meal break duty. 
It appears that the assailant was known to the victim, having passed through the station yesterday.

As per the female customer, the man did not apologise or stop to check on her. She was very infuriated and almost in tears when she was narrating the incident to station staff.

As we she was narrating the incident to myself the customer walked back into the station and the woman confronted him. I attempted to negotiate with the man to apologise to the woman. 

He went straight into a rant with swear language, who the fxxk am I? what the fxxk can I do to him. He kept verbally swearing at both myself and lady customer mainly telling both of us to Fxxk off!!!. He also said he doesn’t care and I can report him to the police for all he cares. No one can touch him.

This infuriated the female customer some more so she started shouting in the ticket hall. The man walked away and said to me he doesn’t give a fxxk and I can follow him to Harold wood for all he cares. 

I could smell alcohol on the man besides he was staggering indicating to me, he was intoxicated. 

I implored to the  lady to report the matter to the police but she said a similar incident happened to her but the police did nothing and that they do not care.

All the males had double gated via the exit WAG and went into Sainsburys supermarket next door to the station.

A few mins thereafter, shopping centre security staff and Sainsburys security staff had escorted the group of males from Sainsburys and the boys were asked to leave.
CSA JO heard the males jeering and being verbal abusive to the shopping centre security.

A little while later, approx 10 mins later, a customer came into the station and stated that a lady was being attacked in the shopping centre. According to CSA1, the lady was very scared and did not want to hang around. The customer asked CSA to 'please help as the lady is being attacked'. CSA1 stated he could hear a woman screaming in the shopping centre from the ticket hall area. CSA looked to see who was screaming and noticed the same group of males who had double gated earlier  were whooping and laughing in the shopping centre. 

2 of the males walked past CSA1 and headed into the station, carrying what appeared to be small boxes of doughnuts. They entered the station and doube gated via the entry WAG. The security guard from the shopping centre came into the ticket hall and followed in the direction of the males. As the security guard turned around, CSA1 stated that he felt something hit him on the side of his head and passed by. CSA stated he was shook up but it did not hurt him. 
CSA questioned the males that threw the box of doughnuts. one of the males said 'boss, boss, we didnt mean to hit you'.

the security guard from the shopping centre wanted to be let in to the paid side of the station and CSA had let him in. The security guard then decided to come back out. 
Again, one of the males who had double gated stated, ' we didnt mean to hit you'.

After a few mins, a few more males (fitting the same description above) who the CSA has recognised in the past with the other males, had also double gated through the way in WAG. 

Security had called Met Police but they said they were too busy to come.
CSA did mention via radio to the CSM to call BTP but was unable to get through, and the assailants had already boarded the train. 
CSM asked CSA if they wish to report the incident to BTP and they declined. CSA stated he did not wanted to call the police as the assailants didnt say anything personal to him and recognised that it was an accident. CSA also stated that he was not hurt.
