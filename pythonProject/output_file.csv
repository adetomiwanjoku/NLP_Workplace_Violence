As CSM GN03 pulled across the Bostwick gate situated by the computer room and inspected Switch Room (E5), a black male passenger was attempting to force his way through WAG22 on the paid side.  

The black male spots CSM GN03 then asks to let him 'in'. CSM GN03 enquired from the customer what he meant by letting him in? The male customer responded that, at the start of his journey he did not touch in. CSM GN03 asked which station he started from, and he replied Kings Cross he added that he did not want to be overcharged if he touched out.  

CSM GN03 advised him to touch out and that she will resolve the journey. He replied with a short and aggressive no! CSM GN03 sensed that the male would become more aggressive, so she proceeded to the Sprinkler Valve Chamber to continue with her station checks and to remove herself from the situation. The black male passenger was not happy with that, stating that he had been disrespected by CSM GN53 by her moving away. After coming out of the Sprinkler Valve Chamber, the male had remained in the same position and immediately started shouting at CSM GN03 becoming even more threatening and confrontational, walking directly up into her face. Black male passenger also stated to CSM GN03 that the next time she disrespected him, he would deal with her later. He further mentioned that black women do not have respect. CSM GN03 activates Body Worn Camera 240432 and remained silent in response to the black male passengers rage and was really afraid for her safety.

Customer Service Assistant GN55 witnessed the whole incident, and five escalator engineers heard the shouting and came out to investigate and to offer any assistance or support.

He tapped it on the MFM and said it has money on there he has just topped it up, I could also see the photo was deliberately defaced so asked him to hand me the card so I could try it on the gate and as I did I explained to him that the card has been cancelled most likely due to it being reported lost or stolen.
He said no he had just topped it up, I explained that the card does not belong to him and he should not be using it but he replied that the oyster card was his wife's card which was clearly not the case.

When we arrived, I observed a person I would describe as a MALE, appeared to be of INDIAN appearance, in his late 40s, 5ft 11 tall, average build, medium length BLACK GREYING hair, light facial hair, wearing BLACK shoes, BLACK combat style trousers and KHAKI GREEN hooded jacket with hood up, rolling about on the floor, so my colleague CL first asked him to get up however he ignored her request. I then asked him to get up to which he responded by stating, I WILL PUNCH YOU WHEN I GET UP. I then informed him that I was going to call the police and I made my way to the managers office where I requested police attendance. BTP ref 076 01.10.2023 was given.
Whilst awaiting police attendance, I was informed through my colleague CL that INDIAN MALE, had got up on and was walking towards EASTBOUND PLATFORM. I then made my way back to my colleague who was still at SOUTH BRIDGE part of the station where we followed INDIAN MALE to the EASTBOUND PLATFORM. Once we were on the PLATFORM, I observed INDIAN MALE towards the HEADWEALL side of the platform, rolling on the floor, under a platform seat. I requested for my colleague CL to return to the control room, to request a male member of staff to assist. One of the Customer Service Assistants EW (BB47) came down to the platform to assist as I needed to use the toilet. Whilst on my way there, I received a radio call from my colleague on the platform informing me that INDIAN MALE had now gone beyond the platform end barrier and was laying on the other side of the barrier. I immediately returned to the platform where my colleague AA (BB49) was conducting his 5pm station check. At 05:15hrs I arrived and INDIAN MALE got up and walked down the PLATFORM END RAMP and which is considered to be trackside. At this point, 05:15hrs I requested to the PICCADILLY SERVICE CONTROLLER to switch all power off due to a trespasser on the track. I began to request for INDIAN MALE to return to the platform however INDIAN MALE ignored my request and began to walk on the tracks onto the EASTBOUND DISTRICT LINE track. INDIAN MALE began walking back and forth between EASTBOUND DISTRICT LINE track EASTBOUND PICCADILLY LINE track.
I then observed INDIAN MALE climb onto the signal post and he requested for us to let train run. INDIAN MALE then came down from the signal post and lay back down on the PLATFORM END RAMP. At 05:28hrs BRITISH TRANSPORT POLICE OFFICERS arrived and hand cuffed INDIAN MALE. I then updated the PICCADILLY LINE CONTROLLER that INDIAN MALE was under control of the BTP OFFICERS and trains could now run at caution speed. At 05:33hrs trains began to run again at caution speed. 05:48hrs more BTP OFFICERS arrived to assist. At 05:57hrs, BTP officers escorted INDIAN MALE from the platform and into their police van.

Passengers on board car 3 had activated the alarm whilst at West Harrow due to a fellow passenger fainting and fitting on the floor of the train. 

The West Harrow CSS was tasked with attending, the PEA was reset but the CSS was unable to remove the passenger from the train. LAS had already been requested to attend by other passengers on the train, ref 2132.

The Service Controller requested the CSS travel on board the train with the person ill to Harrow where better assistance could be given, LAS were diverted to Harrow on the Hill.

The Metropolitan DRM and Harrow CSM were tasked with attending the platform. At 1251hrs, 433 arrived in p6 at Harrow where staff attempted to rouse the passenger who was still on the floor of the train but to no avail. 

The DRM requested the T/Op of 433 make announcements for passengers to use trains from platform 5 whilst 433 was held in platform 6. 

At 1300hrs, LAS were on site and attended to the passenger who came round in a few minutes and was brought to his feet. During the interaction time with the LAS, the male became very abusive towards them in general and further shouting racial abuse directly at one emergency services member. 

The CSS was able to build a rapport with the male and calm them down after they had previously been verbally aggressive in presence of all LUL staff and LAS staff at the incident. 

At 1304hrs, the DRM requested attendance of BTP via the Service Controller due to aggressive nature and racist language directed towards LAS staff. Ref 353.

The CSS was able to keep the passenger calm and took them to the waiting room on platform 5/6 until BTP arrival. LAS stated that they would remain on site whilst awaiting police so that they were able to keep a check over the male and to provide police with an account.

At 1322hrs, BTP were on site who took an account from the LAS member and further arrested the person who was taken off site by 1329hrs.

Below is a statement taken from the CSA in his own words:

""A member of Greater Anglia staff around 16:05pm on 06/10/2023 approached me at the B way out main gate line at Liverpool Street Underground station re his bearer pass. Im not based at Liverpool Street Underground station so Im unaware of changes to bearer passes etc. Ive known it to be not valid as the route is taken on the mainline concourse. I was told after supposedly its changed. I told the member of Greater Anglia staff that its not valid. The member of Greater Anglia staff became aggressive, got in my face and shouting with waving his hands around. The member of Greater Anglia staff abused me and called me a ""prick"". I do not deserve this whilst I am at work. I do not come to work to be abused. When asking the member of Greater Anglia staff why they called me the abusive name they could not answer. The member of Greater Anglia staff then went up to another member of London Underground staff in the middle of the gate line to be let through. Then waving his hands around aggressively to that member of London Underground staff to which he was saying things about myself. This is totally unacceptable.""

16:45 - CSS JT attended the NR office and spoke to the GA manager. According to the GA manager, the member of staff as described by the CSA does not work at the station. It is likely that he works either at another station or is revenue control staff as he alluded to this during his interaction with the CSA.

16:55 - CSA was taken to the BTP office on platform 10 to make a formal allegation.

T/Op was relieved at Harrow on the Hill for a fact finding interview. T/Op stated that he requested a Personal Needs Relief (PNR) on his southbound journey to Aldgate but, due to the Temporary Speed Restriction (TSR) at Wembley Park, the Service Controller instructed the T/Op to reverse at Moorgate for his booked N/B working. Upon arrival at Moorgate, T/Op went to use the toilet and made his way to the old CSSs office. He used the buzzer a few times and eventually a male member of staff came out of the toilet. T/Op thanked the member of staff and asked for the door buzzer code for future use. Member of station staff replied that the T/Op is not allowed to use the toilet; nobody is allowed to use the toilet and they have been told not to allow anyone to use the facility. T/OP introduced himself that he is a Metropolitan Line train operator, and his train is in the platform. T/Op showed his staff pass to avoid confusion. 
When asked what happened next, T/Op stated that there was enough room between him and the staff member and so he went to the toilet and locked the door. He could hear the member of staff continually shouting for him to get out.
T/Op used the facility and came out the toilet and the member of staff was not there. T/Op Khan stated that he wanted to see the CSS to inform them of the incident and went to the gate line. The member of staff involved in toilet was present at the gate line. T/Op asked him his name for reporting purposes to which member of staff replied that he doesnt need his name and he (T/Op) wasn't going to get it. T/Op then went to the CSS office and made the CSS aware of the altercation. Local CSS offered T/Op a cup of tea to which he politely declined.  
T/Op stated that the attitude of the member of station staff was intimidating and, although he himself is not easily intimidated, it appeared that that was the member of staffs intention. He stated that the behaviour of member of staff was very bad. 
When asked to explain the bad behaviour, he stated that all he asked was to use the toilet which he is entitled to. He had offered to show his staff pass and still was met by intimidation. 

After having spoken to the CSS, T/Op returned to his train and spoke to the signaller and asked for a couple of additional minutes to compose himself. T/Op then carried on to HOH where he was due for a meal relief and welfare check by the local TM. 
T/Op stated that there was no physical threat or altercation and there was nothing else to add.

While on early turn duty, I had left the office to assist a customer by the passenger operated machines after signing in a technician from CUBIC to repair two of our gates on the gate line. As I guided the customer who was unfamiliar with using a paper ticket to where to insert it on the gate, there was a female customer with a buggy waiting to use the wide aisle gate, WAG22 which was in first come first serve mode being the only WAG we have. Two males 1x white male and 1x black male came from behind her walked past her and forced their way out without using a ticket, oyster card or contact less card pushing the paddles open then proceeded to take hold of a paddle each, keeping it open then called out for a female who was still several feet away behind on the exit ramp to come over and exit that way too. I was standing just a few feet away from them. I then asked them why they were holding the paddles open and asked them to leave the paddles alone. The female whom they were waiting for then having gotten close to the gates told them not to worry that she has her pass. Both males then left the paddles of the gate alone and make their way out with the female.
I watched them as they left. The white male then asked me in an angry tone ""What are you looking at?"" and I responded that I was look at him for holding the gate open. He then said to me that if I looked at him that way that he would ""smash my face in"". I activated my body worn camera (number 256599) which caused him to say ""go ahead and activate your camera"". He uttered some other words that I did not quite hear. The black male who was with him also mumbled some intelligible words too as he walked away. They eventually departed crossing the road in front of the station and heading down towards the right-hand side.
The CUBIC technician witnessed their actions and heard what was said. I was delayed by another customer query before I was able to go into the office to report the incident to the British Transport Police.
I have seen both males and the female on a regular basis, they are regular fare evaders that force their way through the WAG and have done this on a number of occasions in the past week where they stand using their bodies to keep the paddles open while they allow others to either enter or exit. They have at times come through the station multiple times in  a day. I have seen them exit at DAGEHNAM EAST station too.

The first male is a white male, 5feet 10 inches tall, slim build, aged between 40 and 50years old, shaven head, wearing glasses, white T-shirt, black jogging bottoms, dark trainers and carrying a black medium sized rucksack.
The second male is a black male, 6feet tall, slim build, short unkempt hair facial hair, aged between 35 and 40years wearing a dark T- shirt and grey jogging bottoms.

A tall black male was threatening to kill an Asian man. As I approached, the aggressor chased the Asian man towards the Exit 1 stairs, shouting threats as he ran. The aggressor threw a metal flask at the man but it missed and both ran out of the station. The man who was being chased returned to the station, identified himself as, an off duty police officer. He said the attack had been unprovoked and asked me to call the police, which I did via 1899, About 1815 the black male returned to the station and attempted to refund an Oyster card. He then became agitated as he said he had been robbed of £1,50 and he began shouting in an incoherent manner. Staff members attempted to help him but his manner towards them was very aggressive and they walked away. I went over to him to try to see what his issue was but he became enraged and ran towards me. I locked myself in the control room and he started punching the window while continuing to shout threats. I instructed staff to go to a place of safety but before they could comply the man left the station. BTP called, but said as he had left there was nothing further they could do.

CSA1 is then seen to walk over to the parked bike and attempt to remove it from the premises as riding bicycles and bicycles that large are not permitted on the premises. YP1 & 2 then intercept CSA1 to prevent him from doing so, a brief struggle thereafter. CSA1 attempts to prevent YP1 & 2 entering any further into the station and onto down escalator 3, however he is unable to. 

[1732] YP1 & 2 take the bicycle down on the Esc 3. CSA1 activates top diamond to prevent an accident as there were multiple members of the public using Esc 3. I (duty CSM - duty CN02) then hear a loud bang from the ticket hall. It then came to light that this was the attempts of YP 1 & 2 to get the bike further down Esc 3. The 2 youths eventually reach the lower concourse area at which point YP1 mounts the bike and rides along Plt 1 E/B, YP2 makes his way down Plt 2 I believe.

I this point after several attempts to convince the youths that bikes of that kind are not aloud on the station and that the train will be requested to remain on the platform until they remove the bike to no avail, I contacted the Pic Line Service Controller to advise of the incident.

[1735] I requested that the controller bring trains in at caution speed owing to YP1 riding along Plt 1 E/B and Plt 2 W/B from an auto phone at Plt 1 E/B Headwall. CSA1 at the same time went onto Plt 2 W/B in order to be ready to speak to the driver of the next train in on that Plt (T322). 

Once driver of T322 held the train, I spoke with the 2 youths again who were in car 2 at which point they both exited the train but left the bike. I removed the bike whilst instructing CSA1 to begin inspecting Esc 3 for damage before assisting him to put it back into service.

[1750] Controller contacted to withdraw caution speed at Hyde Park Corner. BTP arrive on site and interview CSA1 regarding earlier verbal and physical assault by youths.

The male said I dont care what you say Im taking it.

That the same rules apply to everyone it was the fire regulations following the Kings Cross Fire where 31 people died and why does he think that it was ok for just him to break the rules and put other peoples safety in danger. When he did not get the reaction, he was hoping for from the other passengers he became more abusive and threatening to me. He then proceeded to pass his bike over the railings by the emergency stairs. He threatened me telling me not to touch him or his bike I did not touch him.

CSS Eastcote was informed about a VIP customer who was making her way back to Eastcote from Hyde Park Corner and that she would change at Rayners lane as the train was terminating at Rayners lane train 327.

CSS Dsouza then made her way to platform 1 to assist the customer who was on board train 470 from Rayners Lane. 

This is the same customer the CSS has assisted when the customer was on her way to Hyde Park Corner around 16:30 pm and made a log entry about her rude behaviour (as explained above in incident 1)

As informed, CSS went downstairs to platform 1 to assist the customer.
Train 470 arrived, and CSS assisted the customer outside the train. 
Customer was holding the dogs leash in her right hand so CSS moved to the left side. CSS then informed customer that she was on her left. 
Customer them said You need to be on my right (in a rude tone, whilst moving the dogs leash to the left)

The customer asked if CSS Dsouza was the same lady who assisted her earlier.
 CSS said, yes I did.
 The customer started shouting at CSS Dsouza about earlier. 
At this point they were close to the train and platform 
So, CSS asked her to move to the side so they could speak if they customer has any preferences etc while getting onto the train. 
Customer said you listen to me in a loud voice screaming.
Customer said, Do not hold me like this, she was also putting allegations on me that CSS pushed her into the train earlier, which is not true (You could check CCTV for this) At this point as she was screaming and didnt want to speak to the CSS appropriately.

CSS informed her Maam Im not going to continue speaking with you if you speak to me like this. 
I did not push you I was trying to help I even spoke to the T/OP to assist you at Hyde Park corner.

All other customers staring at us at this point.

CSS informed the customer that she did not push the customer at all. The Customer continued screaming whilst holding the CSS by her left forearm and flung it in an aggressive way.

CSS told the customer this is not right. 
Meanwhile another passenger stepped in who was standing there all along (Name  Christine Mckenzee contact 07904181973) 
Christine stepped in and said Thats not the way to speak, the lady is trying to help you Christine also asked the lady if she could help her as the VIP left the CSS and wanted to walk by herself up the stairs.

CSS walked behind the VIP customer up the stairs and informed the VIP that the gates were open for her to pass. 

CSS- Honestly, if the other customer wouldnt step in, CSS doesnt think the VIP customer would stop with the aggression.
Chirstine was willing to be a witness to the assault and gave me her details. Christine also observed the VIP customers behaviour and stated that if a white person was dealing with her the approach would be completed different. Christine also said that the CSS should make a complaint to a team that deals with dignity at work.
Christine did really help calm the CSS down.

CSA Duty CC34 came back stating that the staff member was very rude and missive and declined the invite to come to the control room and they they should tell the CSS that they will come and see once they were finished.
CSA duty CC34 was then asked to sit in the SOR as the station wasn't fully closed to passengers  whilst CSS Duty CC12 went to go speak to them
CC12 told the SRT that they hadn't identified themselves to SOR and that if they wanted to remain on station premises they had to come  had to be signed into station access.  The SRT was very dismissive and was cutting off CSS 12 however they followed the CSS so they can book them on.
Whilst booking on the SRT to station access, CSS CC12 was trying to explain what to do in an evac and ignored them. 
when CSS Duty  CC12 tried to process the lost property , the SRT refused  to hand it over , saying that they were making their own account of the lost property ad they would hand it over and leave once they were done.
CSS Duty CC12 explained that they would  process the lost property with them so that they were sure that none of the item were omitted and that they would  emailed proof  but the SRT abruptly interrupted the CSS saying that they didn't have time , that they were going to make an account of the item and dump it. 
CSS stated that they would not take the item if they do not wait and witness the item being processed  due to the fact that they could be discrepancy to their account of the item. the SRT then began calling the CSS a dumb Bitch.

Metropolitan Line services routed via the Southbound Local Line between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Wembley Park were delayed in consequence.

At 23:08 the Customer Service Supervisor (CSS) that had completed the late shift at Northwick Park station was approached by two members of the public whilst walking up the stairs from the ticket hall to Platforms 1 and 2, and then subjected to an unprovoked verbal assault by one of these individuals, an IC3 male of approximately 25 years of age. The CSS attempted to diffuse the situation but was then spat at by the male, who had taken a sip from a bottle of water in their possession to ensure that the CSS was soaked with what the male described as ""holy water"". The male then proceeded to throw the remaining contents of the water bottle at the CSS.

This assault was witnessed in part by the CSS commencing a night shift at Northwick Park, who recorded events from their perspective with a Body Worn Video camera, and was subsequently reported to the Metropolitan Line Service Controller by the Train Operator of S464, with whom the CSS took refuge. The alleged assailant and their companion were observed standing on Platform 2 by the T/Op whilst they passed report to the Controller, and they were instructed to depart Northwick Park before the assailants boarded the train in order to separate them from the CSS. The train duly departed Platform 2 for Preston Road at 23:13, after an initial service delay of 5 minutes.

It was initially believed that the alleged assailant and their companion had boarded the following train, S473, so this was held upon its arrival  into Wembley Park Platform 5 at 23:19 to facilitate a search of the train by British Transport Police (BTP) officers deployed to Wembley Park for this purpose. No persons matching the description of the assailant and their companion were located, and the train was therefore permitted to depart for Finchley Road after a short delay. It was subsequently ascertained that the two persons in question had exited Northwick Park station via the entrance to Northwick Avenue at 23:14.

Duty of care activities in respect of this incident were carried out by the Wembley Park Customer Service Manager (CSM), who spoke with the CSS after they had alighted from S464 at Wembley Park to assist BTP with their search of S473. Trauma Support Group assistance was not however extended to the CSS because they had indicated that they just wanted to get home following the conclusion of their duty and subsequent assault. 

The CSS assailant has been described as an IC3 male of 25 years of age, who was wearing a black jacket, black trousers, black shoes and a black hat. They were estimated to be around 6 feet one inch tall. Their companion, who had attempted to restrain them during the assault, was described as a female of about 5 feet and three inches in height, who was wearing a beige jacket. The male was noted to have tapped into the wide aisle gate at Northwick Park station shortly before the assault using their smart phone so it may be possible to identify them from the data recorded.",Threat,,CSS2,,,,,,,,,,,,7,,,"S464 was delayed departing Northwick Park Platform 2 for Preston Road whilst incident responders dealt with the unprovoked assault of a member of London Underground staff.

Finchley Central station supervisor had previous reported a disturbance involving 2x aggressive males.

Following initial reports of antisocial behaviour in the southbound platform waiting room, the station supervisor discreetly carried out a station check. Upon entering the waiting room, he was immediately subjected to unprovoked aggression to the extend that he felt the need to retreat to the supervisor's office for his own safety.

At this point one of the males followed him and started banging on the door of the supervisor's office. Both males then boarded S12 and travelled to East Finchley.

Upon arrival at East Finchley a further disturbance occurred with the males now stating a passenger had kicked their dog.

After this disturbance subsided, S12 departed, however at this point the two males then started following the East Finchley station supervisor, who like her colleague also felt the need to retreat to the supervisor's office for her own safety.

At 23:06 BTP on side. A search was carried out however the males could not be located.

It was at this point that CSA 2690228  brought the bag to the Control room.  The bag was not processed at this time as we suspected that he might come back, which he did.
The male came to the control room window for his bag.  He got very irate when i told him that he was not able to travel for free and that he cannot just leave his bag on the station as this was a security risk.  He started calling me a ""PUSSY HOLE""  and many other expletives.  I told him that if he did not calm down, i would call the police.  He did not, even taking off his jacket and inviting me outside.

When I reached the bottom a white male customer had picked the dog up, but he said he was not the owner but said he would take it upstairs. As he stepped onto the escalator a black male about 50 yrs, slim, shaved head, light blue jumper, blue jeans and white trainers identified himself as the dog owner to the white male carrying the dog. I asked if the male was owner and he said it was his sons. I asked if he had a lead which he said was on the platform in a bag. I asked him if he could put the dog on the lead as it was dangerous for the dog. The male said he was going to the toilet and kept saying he was a bus driver and flashed a pass (not TfL) with the name Wayne Garfield. The male very quickly became aggressive and raising his voice.

As the T/Operator started detraining at Goldhawk Road, a customer sitting in the last carriage refused to get off the train inspite of being advised that another train was just behind.

Train Operator arrived at Hammersmith and also informed the desk Trains Manager of what happened before proceeding to his booked meal relief..  After his meal relief, he then alerted the desk TM at Hammersmith depot that he was a bit shake hence unable to operate his next T274 eastbound to Barking.
