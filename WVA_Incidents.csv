Uxbridge supervisor then radioed to inform that the incident started on the platform at uxbridge and when she went to investigate it was a dispute between partners and it was not violent.
 As the train pulled in the platform, customers hurried me onto the train as there was an black lady, late 20s/early 30s harassing a white male, 60s/70s and a large group of youths around her trying to get her to leave the male alone.
i pressed the PEA to hold the train on the platform and asked the lady to get off the train as she was holding everyone up. She started to shout at me and other customers on the train and proceeded to tell the male ' give me money and I'll go' 
Despite the protesting from myself and the customers, the male gave her £20 and in the end she got off, not before hurling insults at everyone on board.
I called Met info to inform them I was the one that pulled the pea and the incident has been resolved, i then walked up to thedriver and informed him that he was okay to leave.
1643 train 431 departed.
 As i walked back to the lady I found her urinating on the platform and i informed her that she needed to leave the station however she refused. 
1645 Train 432 pulled in and she boarded, i called met info again and asked to hold the train and asked Uxbridge to call call BTP, MET info then informed me that BTP was en route to the station. (met info ref 442, Uxbridge ref 453121223) 
she refused to get off the train stating that she needed to go to Hammersmith i told her that the train would not be moving with her on the train.
Customers advised her that the train would not take her to Hammersmith she'd need the Piccadilly line and she got off. I called back Met info and said it was okay for 432 to leave as she was on it, she needed the Piccadilly train.
1649 Train 432 departed.
it was decided that 433 would non stop at the station to avoid further disruptions and delays.
I told her she needed to leave the station and she hurled abuse at me and started to curse me out. saying things 'you evil bitch, get a job, you fat bitch, i'll kill you, i'll punch you up, you fucking cunt' etc
As we approached the bottom of the stairs she proceeded to grab my hair and drag me she attempted to drag me down but was unable to. she then kept trying to reach for me. 
After a lot of back and forth we made our way upstairs i went into the office to get a BWC (237584) and made my way back out where she was requesting a cigarette from a customer. 
She hurled more abuse and after more back and forth she left the premises.

The Train Operator informed the Metropolitan Line Service Controller about the incident but declined to attend for fear of his own safety. He was under the initial impression that approximately 20 customers were involved in a fight in car 8. The Eastcote Customer Service Supervisor (CSS) and the Metropolitan Line Duty Reliability Manager (DRM) were tasked to attend.

The British Transport Police were summoned (reference 442).

A 6 minute delay was recorded.",Physical,,CSS2,,,,,,,,,,,,10,,,,,,,,UK_IRF001320703,,,,,,,,,,,,,,442,"Abridged Incident Timeline

1638 hours - PEA car 8 E431 P2 Eastcote station. CSS, DRM and BTP tasked to attend following a report of an altercation between customers on board the train.

The incident had started at Uxbridge station at approximately 1625 hours when a Customer Service Assistant reported a verbal altercation between a male customer (approximately 70 years old) and a female customer (aged between 25 and 30) on platform 2. Both customers reportedly knew each other. Both customers boarded E431 on platform 2 just prior to it's departure.

1645 hours - The aggressive and abusive female customer in car 8 is assisted off the train and onto the platform at Eastcote by fellow customers. E431 departs after the PEA in car 21048 has been re-set.

The attending CSS reports that the female customer, as reported by the staff at Uxbridge earlier, was verbally harassing her elderly male companion for money. She states that customers in the carriage got involved in the altercation in a bid to stop the verbal harassment. After being assisted onto the platform by fellow customers, the CSS reports that the anti social female customer pulled down her jogging pants and urinated on the platform. The customer discarded the pants she was wearing on the platform in favour of another she had with her.

1646 hours - The anti social female customer boards E432 upon it's arrival on platform 2 Eastcote. The Metropolitan Line Service Controller holds all eastbound services at Uxbridge whilst the Eastcote CSS attempts to persuade the female customer to alight from the train. 

1650 hours - E432 departs Eastcote after the female customer is convinced to alight from the train after she is assured that it would not be going to her destination; Hammersmith. Eastbound services non-stopping platform 2.

The Eastcote CSS reports that the abusive and aggressive female customer threatened to kill her (multiple times), called her a "" dirty African b**** "" and pulled her by the hair prior to leaving the station by the main exit. The CSS proceeded to advise staff at stations either side of Eastcote to expect the female customer who was determined to get to Hammersmith.

1707 hours - The Metropolitan Line DRM arrives at Eastcote station and assesses the CSS's physical and metal state following her assault by the female customer. The Harrow Customer Service Manager arrives and attends to the CSS's immediate welfare prior to offering access to local Trauma Support resources.

1709 hours - Two BTP officers arrive at Eastcote station. They take a brief description off the assailant and details of her last known location outside the station before heading off in search.

Basic Cause:

On-board customer altercation that commenced on the platform at Uxbridge station and culminated in the racial and physical abuse of the Eastcote Customer Service Supervisor.",,12/12/2023 00:00

 - Anti-Social Behaviour - Revenue Dispute / Touting - Employee did not request support from their manager",Other,,CSS2,,,,,,,,,,,,10,,,,,,,,UK_IRF001320349,,,,,,,,,,,,,,428-12123,"Fare evasion is historically high on the London Underground network. Some members of the general public are familiar with how easy it is to force open the paddles of the wide isle gate (WAG) at the station gate line. This is in order to pass through it without paying for their journey. The fare evasion at Barons Court station is generally low in comparison with other stations that I have previously worked at. However, during  commute times of the attendees (students) of local colleges near to the station, fare evasion takes place at an unacceptable level. Station staff have reported this multiple times on the WAASB reporting app, but nothing is done to respond to this issue. Station staff are  concerned to see a deterioration in the behaviour of the students. They have been witnessed forcing open the staff access lid of the WAG  in order to operate the key pad inside. When the lid is difficult to open they kick it causing damage. They also cause an inconvenience to other customers when they occasionally don't wait for their turn to pass through the gate. Then further delay for the customer as the gate alarm re-sets itself. Station staff can also be faced with the complaints from paying customers. These complaints are often made in an unpleasant  and insulting manner. This is creating a very unpleasant environment for station staff and customers. It is also affecting the operation of the station. This is when station staff remove themselves to a place of safety and the WAG is required to be left open owing to the damage caused by it being excessively forced open by the public. The gate can be in the open position for a whole day while spare parts are being arranged by CUBIC. Owing to the type of criminality that is now taking place, staff have reported this directly to the BTP via their online rail worker facility. This is an historical ongoing issue.",,13/12/2023 00:00

Immediately went to investigate and found an IC3 Male disrupting the closing door. Male was questioned about his behaviour of holding doors. Immediately went furious and shouted and swearing at me whilst delaying the service. Male stated about his actions holding doors and has been doing repeatedly in the past. I mentioned that if he continues to do so he will have to come off from the train and leave as he has delayed the service on the platform. Male jumped and started arguing with me by being head to head and grabbed my high vis and pulled it hard enough that the velcro started ripping. The male was continuously screaming and swearing at me when suddenly some customers stopped him and he kept on swearing. Meanwhile the train was gone and my colleague as well tried to escalate this issue. The Male waited for the next train on the platform and made his way to Hayes & Harlington.
